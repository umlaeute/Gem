This is GEM 0.88-1
===================
You can get the current release (0.87) from:
http://iem.kug.ac.at/GEM
ftp://iem.kug.ac.at/pd/Externals/GEM

You can get a current unstable version via cvs from cvs.gem.iem.at:
"cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.gem.iem.at:/cvsroot/pd-gem co Gem"

assumption:
throughout this document, references of DOS actually means the OS from Redmont (known as Windoze)


=============================================
NEW:::
------
As with GEM-0.87, i have broken the distribution into various packages
Gem-<gemver>.tgz :: quite everything (except binaries and auxiliary libraries)
Gem-doc-<gemver>.tgz :: example-patches, manual, ...
Gem-src-<gemver>.tgz :: the sources (which are identical for DOS and linux)
Gem-bin-<gemver>.zip :: DOS-binary (containing a single file "Gem.dll")

GemLibs-<OS>-<libver>.tgz :: auxiliary libraries (used to be "AuxLibs")

1) the core Gem-packages:
the core Gem-packages all extract into the same directory gem-<gemver>/
there are install-scripts for windoze (and probably IRIX) users like GEM.INSTALL.bat
these will install the documentation...


2) the GemLib-package:
I don't know, whether it has much sense, to break the core Gem-package (doc/src/bin),
but i do know, that the GemLibs should be in a distinct package (just for the sake of downloading)

the GemLibs have their own version numbering, starting with 1.
You can get the newest GemLib from the place mentioned above


DEPENDENCIES:
=============
current version: GEM-0.87
