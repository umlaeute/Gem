This is GEM 0.90
===================
You can get the current distribution from:
http://gem.iem.at
ftp://iem.at/pd/Externals/GEM

assumption:
throughout this document, references of DOS actually means the OS from Redmont (known as Windoze)


=============================================
NEW:::
------

Gem is now supported by DOS, linux and macOS
the IRIX version might work (but most probably will not): if you want to use Gem under IRIX,feel free to make it work and report failure and success to me, so i can incorporate any needed changes into the main Gem-trunk.

for installation instructions see below


NEW (gem-0.87):::
-----------------
(note: this NEWs only refer to the packaging, not to features of Gem)

As with GEM-0.87, i have broken the distribution into various packages
gem-<gemver>.tgz :: quite everything (except binaries and auxiliary libraries)
gem-doc-<gemver>.tgz :: example-patches, manual, ...
gem-bin-<gemver>.zip :: DOS-binary (containing a single file "Gem.dll")
gem-bin-doc-<gemver>.zip :: DOS-binary + documentation

GemLibs-<OS>-<libver>.tgz :: auxiliary libraries (used to be "AuxLibs")

1) the core Gem-packages:
the core Gem-packages all extract into the same directory gem-<gemver>/
there are install-scripts for windoze (and probably IRIX) like GEM_INSTALL.bat
these will install the documentation...


2) the GemLib-package:
I don't know, whether it has much sense, to break the core Gem-package (doc/src/bin),
but i do know, that the GemLibs should be in a distinct package (just for the sake of downloading)

the GemLibs have their own version numbering, starting with 1.
You can get the newest GemLib from the place mentioned above


DEPENDENCIES:
=============
current version: GEM-0.90
GemLibs	>= 1
PD 	>= 0.34

-------------------------------------
-------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:
=============

To install GEM on DOS:

a) use the script

	1) unzip the GEM package so that it is located at pd/gem

	2) edit line 3&6 of the GEM_INSTALL.bat file to match your installation of pd

	3) run GEM_INSTALL.bat
	    - this will put everything where it should be

	4) Read the FAQ for instructions to run Pd and GEM

	5) Check the release notes for changes and usage information

	6) Use the manual html files to learn how to use GEM


b) do it by hand

	1) unzip the GEM package

	2) put the Gem.dll-file somewhere pd can find it (e.g.: ...\pd\extra)

	3) when using pd>=0.37, copy the entire "help"-folder into the same place where the Gem.dll lies
	   rename the "help"-folder to "help-Gem"
	   you should now have following structure
	     (...)\Gem.dll
	     (...)\help-Gem\
	     (...)\help-Gem\accumrotate.pd
	     
	4) when using pd<0.37, copy the entire "help"-folder into the pd's reference path ( ...\pd\doc\5.reference)
	   rename the newly created "help"-folder to "Gem"
	   you should have following structure
	   (...)\pd\extra\Gem.dll
	   (...)\pd\doc\5.reference\Gem\
	   (...)\pd\doc\5.reference\Gem\accumrotate.pd

note: in prior versions of Gem, GLUT was needed; this is obsolete


-------------------------------------
To install GEM on linux:
chdir into <Gemdir>/src/Gnu
read the README.build etc...

-------------------------------------

RUNNING:
========

just installing Gem is not enough !
you will have to tell pd that it should load that library !!
you cannot create any Gem-objects without having loaded the Gem-library into pd !!!

make sure you have the proper binary for you OS
  - windows: Gem.dll
  - macOS  : Gem.pd_darwin
  - linux  : Gem.pd_linux
  - irix   : Gem.pd_irix

when starting pd, tell it to load Gem with the "-lib" flag
if your Gem-binary lives in pd/extra/, you could just try "pd -lib Gem"
if your Gem-binary lives somewhere else use something like "pd -lib /path/to/my/Gem"
you could also use "pd -path /path/to/my -lib Gem"
after loading Gem you will see a bit of a welcome message on the konsole

NOTE: there *must not* be any file extension with the "-lib"-flag:: "pd -lib Gem.dll" will miserably fail
NOTE: please note the spelling: it is "Gem" and not "gem" nor "GEM"

if you have problems loading any library including Gem, have a look at the pd-documentation
if you have problems loading just Gem (but other libraries work), send me a bug-report (see below)

BUG-REPORT:
===========
if your mail only says "hey, it does not work !", it is an annoyance and no bug-report
please specify at least the following things:

	Operating-System (kernel-version,...)
	video-card, driver
	other hardware that is related to your problem (e.g.: camera)
	does your system work with similar applications (e.g.: capture-software, openGL (games, "glxgears")
	what is the output of pd when you start it with the "-verbose" flag (e.g.:"pd -verbose -lib Gem")
