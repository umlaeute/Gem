This folder contains a Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express (that's why it is called -vce2010) solution to build Gem for Puredata.

If you want to built it from scratch yourself, you're very welcome and the how_to_build_Gem_on_windows.pdf could be a good starting point.
Feel free to improve it yourself with your headache (because YES you will have some...).
