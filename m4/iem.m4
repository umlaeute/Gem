#
# SYNOPSIS
#
#   IEM_CHECK_INCLUDES_DEFAULT
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Extend the default-includes (AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT)
#
#   Given a list of headers to check, this macro adds each each header to the
#   AC_INCLUDES_DEFAULT (surrounded by a protecting #ifdef).
#   If the header is actually present on the system, a corresponding HAVE_...
#   is defined.
#
#   Example:
#
#   IEM_CHECK_INCLUDES_DEFAULT([windows.h])
#
# will define HAVE_WINDOWS_H (if the header is found, e.g. on w32 systems) and
# add the following to your headers:
#     #if defined(HAVE_WINDOWS_H)
#     # include <windows.h>
#     #endif
AC_DEFUN([IEM_CHECK_INCLUDES_DEFAULT], [
   for __iem_check_includes_default_hdr in $1; do
       AC_CHECK_HEADERS([${__iem_check_includes_default_hdr}])
       ac_includes_default="${ac_includes_default}
[#]ifdef AS_TR_CPP([HAVE_${__iem_check_includes_default_hdr}])
[#] include <${__iem_check_includes_default_hdr}>
[#]endif"
   done
])
