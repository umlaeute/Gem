2008-05-08 18:29  zmoelnig

	* added "bang" aliases for "snap"

2008-05-08 12:07  zmoelnig

	* mutex to prevent multiple installers running at the same time

2008-05-08 12:00  zmoelnig

	* dumped the binary vs bin-doc thing and just create a single

2008-05-06 10:03  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up a bit...

2008-05-06 09:21  zmoelnig

	* this crashes on an ati-X2300; added a #warning to indicate where

2008-05-06 09:03  zmoelnig

2008-05-06 08:26  zmoelnig

	* try to get rid of the "no window made" error in

	* removed platform dependent code

2008-05-05 10:52  zmoelnig

	  again and add methods to access it

2008-05-05 09:37  eighthave

	* Addressing bug #1941962

	  The colors are still off using Pd-0.40.3-extended-20080502 on Mac
	  OS X 10.4.11 when this patch is run without adding the [pix_yuv],
	  so I added [pix_yuv] and checked the patch into CVS.	I hope it

	* fixed spelling

2008-05-02 11:34  zmoelnig

	* do something when the error-handler is called in the createWindow
	  function; this should prevent the window to be created on
	  ubuntu/hardy and some gfx-cards which is better than freezing the
	  machine

2008-04-30 19:46  zmoelnig

	* use messages "dimen" instead of "dim"

2008-04-28 12:56  nusmuk

2008-04-22 11:35  zmoelnig

	* coming to an end (at least on w32)

2008-04-22 10:50  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos in initialization

2008-04-22 10:42  zmoelnig

	  [pix_fiducialtrack] not useable on w32, but the object can be
	  created

2008-04-11 20:32  zmoelnig

	* added some libfidtrack-files (actually  just
	  libfidtrack_segment.cpp); libfidtrack_treeidmap() fails to link
	  and libfidtrack_fidtrackX depends on it)

2008-04-11 15:03  zmoelnig

	* moved stuff around to make it more readable

2008-04-11 14:55  zmoelnig

2008-04-08 15:27  zmoelnig

2008-04-07 18:11  zmoelnig

	* a working draft (no FTGL, image, DirectShow yet)

2008-04-07 17:33  zmoelnig

	* added a new project for M$VC2003 (not working yet)

	* fixed parameters for the toon-shader

2008-03-10 17:48  zmoelnig

2008-03-04 16:10  zmoelnig

	* transmit GLuint's over t_float

2008-02-20 14:27  zmoelnig

2008-01-23 13:27  zmoelnig

	  80)

2008-01-23 13:25  zmoelnig

	* added autoflip to QuickTime code (e.g. if imageStruct holds an
	  image that is NOT upside-down, it will be flipped to become a
	  correct QuickTime image)

2008-01-22 10:06  zmoelnig

	* use imageStruct memberfunctions to handle types and reallocation:
	  removes a lot of ifdefs and thus makes the code more readable

	* fixed cases for os-x includes (fixes bug#1613373)

2007-02-12 23:33  tigital

	* small changes to get correct colors on intel macs

2007-02-12 22:43  tigital

	* small change to get correct colors on intel macs

2007-01-07 23:32  tigital

	* added GL_VERSION_2_0 compile path for non-ARB glsl functions

2007-01-07 20:52  zmoelnig

	* proper calling of CPPExtern::error() in the static member
	  functions

2006-12-07 19:19  cclepper

	* quick fix for YUV 3x3 on x86.  for now it just does the generic
	  loop.

2006-12-06 21:08  cclepper

	* added an ifdef to make sure this is not compiled on OSX.
	  pix_filmDarwin is used instead

2006-12-06 20:56  cclepper

	* added an ifdef to make sure this is not compiled on OSX.
	  pix_movieDarwin is used instead

2006-12-06 20:44  cclepper

	* added another ifdef to make sure this is not compiled on OSX

2006-12-04 16:35  zmoelnig

	* sped things up a bit; cleaned up post()

2006-12-04 10:11  zmoelnig

	* added comment about initial state and a note, that you now can
	  set this initial state via arguments

2006-12-04 10:09  zmoelnig

	* add an optional argument to the object, so the initial state can
	  be given at object creation (thanks cyrille for the request)

2006-11-25 21:04  zmoelnig

	* added "saturate" message to turn saturation on/off; fixed bug in
	  MMX code with gains>1; added initial arguments

2006-11-21 13:10  zmoelnig

	* less warnings when compiling

2006-11-21 13:00  zmoelnig

	* nobody uses this and if they do, it wouldn't work anyhow

2006-11-21 12:58  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation a tiny bit...

2006-11-21 12:57  zmoelnig

	* minor code cleanup

2006-11-21 11:10  zmoelnig

	* bail out when using wrong messages

2006-11-15 12:12  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo (it is __GNUC__ and not __GNUC___)

2006-11-15 12:08  zmoelnig

	* more verbosity when disabling the culprit altivec stuff (since
	  the code does not seem to work and i don't know why...watch out
	  for the autobuild logs tomorrow...)

2006-11-14 11:58  zmoelnig

	* disable YUV422_to_YV12_altivec() for gcc<4.0 via the
	  NO_VECTORINT_TO_VECTORUNSIGNEDINT define (the fix yesterday
	  coukdn't have worked); btw YUV422_to_YV12_altivec() is really
	  _unused_ in the current sources!!

2006-11-14 11:34  zmoelnig

	* can't use methods with "float, symbol" type; have to use A_GIMME
	  instead

2006-11-13 16:49  zmoelnig

	* disabling __VEC__ for older gcc's (<4); LATER fix the code

2006-11-12 16:20  zmoelnig

	* print credits on first object creation

2006-11-12 16:14  zmoelnig

	* removed the default "HAVE_ARTOOLKIT"; this is checked by
	  configure

2006-11-12 16:05  zmoelnig

	* added shigeyuki's [pix_artoolkit]

2006-11-12 16:04  zmoelnig

	* checks for artoolkit

2006-11-08 21:30  zmoelnig

	* added example file for the use of [gemframebuffer]; note that i
	  use [pix_texture] instead of [pix_multitexture]

2006-11-08 20:24  zmoelnig

	* removed the [pix_coordinate] stuff, since it is now unneccessary
	  (i thought i removed this already...)

2006-11-06 18:39  zmoelnig

	* fail to load movie when fps get's weird... (LATER fix the ffmpeg
	  code)

2006-11-06 17:48  zmoelnig

	* made film::m_auto protected; from outside it can now only be set
	  via setAuto(); this should make it easier to make optimized
	  decoding paths for sequential reading (e.g. non-random-access)

2006-11-06 17:40  zmoelnig

	* better handling of decoding errors...

2006-11-03 17:50  zmoelnig

	* fixed calls to post()

2006-11-03 09:37  zmoelnig

	* fixed calls to ::error() and ::post()

2006-11-03 09:32  zmoelnig

	* added post() method to CPPExtern.cpp which automatically prepends
	  the object's name (if available); accordingly had to change a lot
	  of uses uses of post() where either the object's name was hard-
	  or softcoded or ::post() was used (in the callback functions)

2006-11-03 09:26  zmoelnig

	* extended the texture-sharing message to: textureID, texCoords,
	  type, flags

2006-11-03 09:25  zmoelnig

	* fixed v4l-1 to work with my usb-2u-cam; v4l-2 starts to work
	  too...

2006-11-03 09:24  zmoelnig

	* updated info-files

2006-11-01 23:33  tigital

	* [pix_multitexture] now works as expected! - new [dimen x y<
	  message needed so that it can determine texcoords - GemShape's
	  SetVertex() has been modified to loop thru glMultiTexCoord2f,
	  when needed - GemState has new variable:  state->multiTexCoords,
	  which is 0 by default, but set in pix_multitexture based on the #
	  of texUnits requested

2006-10-30 21:57  tigital

	* more attempts at fixes for bad type-ing of vec's on 10.3

2006-10-30 19:51  zmoelnig

	* added option to disable "-fPIC"

2006-10-30 19:45  zmoelnig

	* make "-Os" the default on Darwin

2006-10-30 19:37  zmoelnig

	* added more tests for compiler-flags as suggested by tigital
	  (-mpowerpc-gfxopt is turned OFF by default; LATER think about the
	  "-Os" flag on os-x)

2006-10-30 19:24  zmoelnig

	* reverted the type changes (while this still breaks compilation
	  with older gcc's, at least it is functional)

2006-10-30 09:47  zmoelnig

	* oops, fixed typo

2006-10-30 09:46  zmoelnig

	* added check for "-fpascal-strings" which allows us to use
	  pascal-strings (containing '\p') on os-x

2006-10-30 09:26  zmoelnig

	* tried to fix another error with types; NEEDS TESTING

2006-10-26 22:04  tigital

	* fixes for bad type comparisons in some vec_sl()/vec_add and loop
	  comparisons

2006-10-26 22:00  tigital

	* fix for gcc4 warning "'GemException' has virtual functions but
	  non-virtual destructor"

2006-10-22 21:51  zmoelnig

	* finally removed "configure" since it really should be generated
	  (and therefore happens to get out of sync with configure.ac too
	  often)

2006-10-20 19:48  zmoelnig

	* only call glUseProgramObjectARB() in postrender() when we have a
	  linked module (less crashy on systems that don't really support
	  shaders...)

2006-10-20 19:40  zmoelnig

	* changed type of for-loop variable from (size_t) to (singed long
	  long), since unsigned numbers never get negative!

2006-10-18 15:49  zmoelnig

	* store the CONFIGUREFLAGS in Make.config, so that automatic calls
	  to "configure" produce the same results; additionally this should
	  make it possible to just call:
	  'CONFIGUREFLAGS="--with-pd=/bi/ba/bo" make" in a distclean
	  environment and it will build everything; LATER remove
	  configure/aclocal.m4

2006-10-18 13:06  zmoelnig

	* setNorm() now has an effect even if capturing is currently not
	  running; LATER think about making the "mode <norm> <channel>"
	  message work again (it seems like this is some threading problem)

2006-10-18 13:05  zmoelnig

	* fixed if/else at the "mode" message

2006-10-18 12:53  zmoelnig

	* hmm...

2006-10-18 12:52  zmoelnig

	* made it a tiny bit more readable; added accumbuffer-bits to
	  window-creation

2006-10-18 12:50  zmoelnig

	* example for texture-sharing

2006-10-18 12:46  zmoelnig

	* dont use markEx-objects anymore; LATER remove this example
	  altogether

2006-10-18 12:44  zmoelnig

	* dont use markEx-objects anymore

2006-10-18 12:43  zmoelnig

	* updated to use vera.ttf instead of arial.ttf and to not use
	  markEx-objects anymore

2006-10-18 12:40  zmoelnig

	* dont use markEx-objects anymore

2006-10-18 12:39  zmoelnig

	* updated to use vera.ttf instead of arial.ttf and to not use
	  markEx-objects anymore

2006-10-06 16:53  cclepper

	* updated RGBA pixel packings for Mac Intel

2006-10-06 16:50  cclepper

	* update for proper Mac Intel pixel packing

2006-10-04 13:38  zmoelnig

	* proper initialization (memset(0)) for fidtrackerx (used to crash
	  on my x64_64)

2006-10-03 17:13  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed the check whether OpenGL-framework is used

2006-10-03 17:08  zmoelnig

	* disable checks for libGL and libGLU if we use the
	  OpenGL-framework

2006-10-03 13:51  zmoelnig

	* disable checks for lqt and libquicktime if QuickTime-framework is
	  being used

2006-09-27 14:55  zmoelnig

	* deleted obsoleted objects from this list

2006-09-27 14:53  zmoelnig

	* make pd-binary settable via the PD variable

2006-09-27 12:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the test for AC_PROG_GCC_TRADITIONAL since we use c++
	  instead of cc

2006-09-27 11:53  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed the FFMPEG-thing (the AVCodecContext-check was
	  broken since i changed the language from "C" to "C++")

2006-09-27 11:04  zmoelnig

	* added some magic for FTGL and ffmpeg

2006-09-26 11:56  zmoelnig

	* use our own glew.h (if so)

2006-09-26 11:55  zmoelnig

	* glProgramEnvParameter4fvARB() can only be used if
	  GL_ARB_vertex_program is defined (GL_NV_vertex_program doesn't
	  matter)

2006-09-26 11:27  zmoelnig

	* removed check for "-no-builtin" gcc-flags, since this prevents us
	  from building with older gcc-version

2006-09-25 15:28  zmoelnig

	* regenerated glew from 1.3.4 sources; fixed importGLEW.sh so that
	  it automatically adds the "#ifdef USE_GLEW" clauses around the
	  code

2006-09-21 21:36  zmoelnig

	* added checks for the not-deprecated linking flags on OSX;
	  disabled altivec on x86_64 machines

2006-09-21 16:38  zmoelnig

	* added newline at end of file

2006-09-21 16:32  zmoelnig

	* add generic inlets for each textureunit

2006-09-21 16:31  zmoelnig

	* added PDerror() which calls pd_error() without having to worry
	  about the object ("ourselves")

2006-09-20 17:57  zmoelnig

	* disabled Vertex by default (since it is very experimental)
	  disabled SSE2 by default (since most processors do not yet
	  support it)

2006-09-20 17:56  cclepper

	* added glfrustum call with GEM default setting.  Uncommented some
	  of the matirx calls which get closer to correct rendering.

2006-09-20 17:51  zmoelnig

	* indentation of preprocessor-directives, so i can read them

2006-09-20 09:55  zmoelnig

	* removed the legacy HaveValidContext() function call (since it
	  does no longer exist)

2006-09-19 22:48  cclepper

	* init m_FBOcolor not m_color

2006-09-19 22:42  cclepper

	* added a color message to set the background color.

2006-09-18 13:09  zmoelnig

	* another check for illegal filenames

2006-09-18 12:39  zmoelnig

	* removed MarkEx from Gem

2006-09-18 12:39  zmoelnig

	* removed dependency on [v+] and friends (which are no longer part
	  of Gem)

2006-09-17 17:41  zmoelnig

	* put "float seconds;" in the platform-independent section, since
	  it is used by both __APPLE__ and __WIN32__

2006-09-15 20:15  tigital

	* [OSX] small fix for close() definition

2006-09-14 11:44  zmoelnig

	* hopefully made this work with older openGL-headers

2006-09-14 11:20  zmoelnig

	* put the authors into GemVersion.h and removed the OS-information
	  (since this is blurry)

2006-09-14 11:00  zmoelnig

	* w32 batch file for testing; LATER make this via make

2006-09-13 00:38  cclepper

	* updated to include timers and matrix flipping on windows

2006-09-12 21:58  cclepper

	* adds a timer for the movie framerate on windows.  also flips the
	  image around when a directshow source is used.

2006-09-12 21:54  cclepper

	* adds a timer for the movie framerate on windows.  also flips the
	  image around when a directshow source is used.

2006-09-12 21:44  cclepper

	* added header for GLEW

2006-09-12 21:42  cclepper

	* Quicktime init on first launch for Windows.  This could possibly
	  go in GemWinCreateNT, but it works fine here.

2006-09-12 21:40  cclepper

	* GLEW init code for Windows

2006-09-12 21:37  cclepper

	* added a working SIMD feature check for Windows.

2006-09-11 23:56  cclepper

	* m_auto is passed to the handle.  useful for DirectShow and
	  Quicktime which are more efficient handling auto play than just
	  incrementing a frame counter.

2006-09-11 23:55  cclepper

	* moved m_auto to public member variable

2006-09-11 23:53  cclepper

	* added right inlet frame handling and auto now sets rate

2006-09-07 23:28  cclepper

	* fixed error in SetVertex that made everything square

2006-09-05 17:27  tigital

	* added more informative output when changing mode

2006-09-03 18:50  zmoelnig

	* removed inheritance of GemException from std::exception to not
	  set up M$VC; hope this works

2006-09-02 20:37  zmoelnig

	* use "-path" for searching images

2006-09-02 20:37  zmoelnig

	* added installabs target for installing abstractions; install
	  Gem.${EXT} into pd/extra/Gem/

2006-08-31 21:45  cclepper

	* added a message apative to set the threshold for deinterlacing.
	  also attempted to make the deinterlacing a little nicer looking
	  for RGBA.

2006-08-31 21:36  cclepper

	* changed drawing to use SetVertex() which allows for texturing
	  from texture units other than 0

2006-08-31 20:47  cclepper

	* added texunit message and handling of multiple texture units

2006-08-29 17:34  zmoelnig

	* added "cvs" to the version string

2006-08-29 16:46  zmoelnig

	* removed the tailing slash from BUILDDIR (avoid double-slashes in
	  paths)

2006-08-29 09:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed compilation issue on systems without HAVE_DIRECTSHOW

2006-08-24 23:20  cclepper

	* added HAVE_DIRECTSHOW define to select filmDS or filmAVI

2006-08-24 23:15  cclepper

	* changed defines to add HAVE_DIRECTSHOW

2006-08-24 22:54  cclepper

	* DirectShow class for pix_film on Windows.

2006-08-22 14:05  zmoelnig

	* replaced [v+] and friends with pd-objects

2006-08-22 14:03  zmoelnig

	* dummy objects that print an error when being instantiated,
	  telling the user that the real objects ceased to exist

2006-08-22 13:52  zmoelnig

	* cyrille's stencil buffer patch

2006-08-22 09:52  zmoelnig

	* newline at end of file (after all, C++ MUST have a newline at the
	  EOF)

2006-08-22 09:40  zmoelnig

	* put the DirectShow code into #ifdef's to prevent it from bulding
	  on other platforms; dos2unix

2006-08-21 23:21  cclepper

	* Changed callback to GetCurrentBuffer.  Added method to record
	  video to disk in native format (useful for DV capture).

2006-08-21 23:16  cclepper

	* Object for loading DirectShow files on Windows

2006-08-21 20:48  cclepper

	* fixed cast to GLclampd for depth flag

2006-08-17 13:08  zmoelnig

	* remove the 2nd inlet inherited from [pix_texture] since this
	  object always has its own texture

2006-08-17 13:07  zmoelnig

	* added a second inlet for setting a "remote" texture, which is
	  used optionally if no image is present

2006-08-17 11:13  zmoelnig

	* deleted commented out leftovers; use window-dimensions when given
	  dimensions <=0 (instead of <0)

2006-08-17 10:22  zmoelnig

	* an example on how to use full-screen motion-bluring with
	  feedback-textures

2006-08-16 14:40  zmoelnig

	* autoconf working on OSX

2006-08-16 14:39  zmoelnig

	* deleted [gemorb] and [gemtablet]

2006-08-16 14:31  zmoelnig

	* removed MarkEx from Gem; added Vertex-branch to configure

2006-08-16 14:27  zmoelnig

	* removed MarkEx from Gem

2006-08-16 12:03  zmoelnig

	* better(?) declarations of exceptions...

2006-08-14 17:32  zmoelnig

	* removed debugging printout

2006-08-14 17:31  zmoelnig

	* initialization of treeidmap

2006-08-14 17:07  zmoelnig

	* more arguments to objects that need it

2006-08-14 16:58  zmoelnig

	* allow arguments to objects

2006-08-14 16:37  zmoelnig

	* changed this object to A_GIMME, since default args do not like
	  symbols to come after floats...  LATER: this object should refuse
	  from being created, if the arguments do not match what we expect
	  LATER: there are other objects who also suffer from this...

2006-08-09 19:15  zmoelnig

	* rearranged a bit, so that it is possible to find the "--with-pd"
	  flag in the help...

2006-08-09 19:08  zmoelnig

	* this might work on os-x! changed the behaviour of "--with-pd" so
	  that it's argument should direct to the base-path of pd, where we
	  can find both headers (<pdpath>/src) and libraries (<pdpath>/bin)

2006-08-09 18:44  zmoelnig

	* use "0" instead of NULL for setting characters

2006-08-09 18:40  zmoelnig

	* protect the inclusion of <colormodels.h> with
	  HAVE_QUICKTIME4LINUX

2006-07-27 18:00  zmoelnig

	* use "vera.ttf" as default font (whoa, this could break things!)

2006-07-27 17:59  zmoelnig

	* use GemState->reset() instead of resetting things manually

2006-07-27 17:58  zmoelnig

	* removed the "stereo" membervariable: this is handled by
	  "tickTime"; added a "reset()" method (to be used in [gemhead]
	  instead of resetting things manually)

2006-07-27 17:56  zmoelnig

	* replaced setting GemState->stereo by setting GemState->tickTime;

2006-07-27 14:12  zmoelnig

	* removed an unconditional exception thrown in the constructor

2006-07-25 18:37  zmoelnig

	* use "state->tickTime" instead of "state->stereo" for (not)
	  updating movements

2006-07-25 16:47  zmoelnig

	* made the warning go away. a bit more text...

2006-07-20 20:45  tigital

	* removed "GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_DUPLICATE_ATTACHMENT_EXT" from
	  fbo status checking because it has been removed from the spec

2006-07-20 19:09  tigital

	* add info about compat message

2006-07-12 06:47  tigital

	* replaced "colorspace" with separate "type" and "format" messages
	  (also can affect creation args): default type=GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE
	  and format=GL_RGB; more informative (and more gem-like) error
	  reporting; better setup of fbo's; switchable textureType
	  (default=GL_TEXTURE_2D); better cleanup

2006-07-12 06:26  tigital

	* [osx] "type = ..._REV" or not: compile-time check for
	  __BIG_ENDIAN__, to help support intel-macs

2006-07-12 06:22  tigital

	* [osx] start of code to detect altivec at runtime

2006-07-12 06:21  tigital

	* [osx] possibility of using generic float (software) renderer:
	  should come up with a way to switch between renderer's at runtime

2006-07-12 06:19  tigital

	* [osx] check for resource's existence before releasing them

2006-07-12 06:17  tigital

	* added glTexParameteri()'s; removed auto texcoord generation (for
	  now...); better support for older GL's; seems to work (atm) with
	  geo's

2006-07-12 06:04  tigital

	* starting to merge in vertex_array stuff (finally) - accepts
	  tables in this order atm: vertex, color, normal, texcoord

2006-07-12 06:00  tigital

	* starting to merge in vertex_array stuff (finally)

	* starting to merge in vertex_array stuff (finally)

2006-07-04 16:48  zmoelnig

	* use setCSizeByFormat()

2006-07-04 16:47  zmoelnig

	* use a define for the debug-printout at decoder-instantiation:
	  makes code much more readable

2006-07-04 16:46  zmoelnig

	* the convert(To|From) routines now also work without an explicit
	  colorspace; if none is given, the already set cs of the
	  destination is taken; if this is unset, the default cs is used

2006-07-03 11:06  zmoelnig

	* replaced sprintf() by snprintf(); replaced printf() by
	  post()/error()

2006-07-03 10:45  zmoelnig

	* lowered the threshold of insecurity by replacing usleep() with
	  select()

2006-07-03 10:44  zmoelnig

	* lowered the threshold of insecurity with snprintf(), select(),...

2006-06-26 04:28  tigital

	* xcode 2.3 project file, makes dynamiclib

2006-06-20 11:03  zmoelnig

	* forgot to remove the debugging "read"s...

2006-06-14 12:20  zmoelnig

	* generated from configure.ac

2006-06-14 12:20  zmoelnig

	* the SIMD-tests are only done if required explicitely by the user
	  (e.g.  --enable-mmx) or the compiling hardware seems to support
	  it (naive test: if ARCH="i686" we want "sse2" and "mmx" but not
	  "altivec" and the like); LATER make better tests (query processor
	  capabilities)

2006-06-14 12:17  zmoelnig

	* generated from acinclude.m4 (with automake-1.9)

2006-06-14 12:16  zmoelnig

	* the GEM_ARG_WITH macro family now doesn't explicitely set the
	  default value, unless a 3rd argument is given and a non-empty
	  string (like "force")

2006-06-14 11:25  zmoelnig

	* why...these files should have been deleted a long time ago...

2006-06-14 11:02  zmoelnig

	* removed non-free fonts and added one free replacement; added a
	  COPYING.txt which discusses licensing.  LATER think about
	  changing the default font to "vera.ttf"

2006-06-14 10:56  zmoelnig

	* oops, forgot to check in the changes for fain-grained control
	  over SIMD-optimization

2006-06-14 00:45  cclepper

	* commented out the fps post() on the Mac since that goes out the
	  outlet

2006-06-14 00:41  cclepper

	* used #if 0 to remove the object from the build process. need to
	  use some proper defines until the new version works as well as
	  the old

2006-06-14 00:31  cclepper

	* should work for Mac/Win now

2006-06-14 00:30  cclepper

	* moved m_recordStart and m_recordStop to the base class.
	  commented out the not implemented getCodecName and
	  getCodecDescription

2006-06-14 00:28  cclepper

	* moved m_recordStart and m_recordStop to the base class

2006-06-14 00:25  cclepper

	* Used one #ifdef to keep from crashing on Mac/Win.  m_automatic is
	  now true by default.

2006-06-13 23:31  cclepper

	* Added a very clever #if 0 to remove this file from compilation.

2006-06-13 23:29  cclepper

	* updated header file for volume function

2006-06-13 23:26  cclepper

	* Added a very clever #if 0 to remove this file from compilation.

2006-06-09 21:07  cclepper

	* changed maxStackDepth declarations to match.	both are GLint

2006-06-09 21:05  cclepper

	* updated header file for quality function

2006-06-09 21:04  cclepper

	* updated header file for volume function

2006-06-09 15:06  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up setCSizeByFormat() to only one big (#ifdef __APPLE__
	  #else) instead of 6 of them: should be more readable

2006-06-08 17:36  zmoelnig

	* clean up shared memory needed when the segment already exists but
	  is smaller than what we requested

2006-06-08 13:55  zmoelnig

	* removed freeShm() from the destructor since the parent's
	  destructor already handles this: the joys of inheritance

2006-06-01 15:58  zmoelnig

	* prefixed V4L2-specific defines with V42L_; added loads of
	  debugging stuff but still couldn't make it work...

2006-06-01 15:55  zmoelnig

	* prefixed V4L-specific defines with V4L_; better checks on
	  stopTransfer()

2006-06-01 15:52  zmoelnig

	* added some more tests for defines when we are on w32

2006-05-31 16:05  zmoelnig

	* reschedule a rendering-cycle when changing the framerate from 0.0
	  to something valid (normally the framerate change only takes
	  effect at the next render-cycle; with framerate==0.0 this can
	  take a long time)

2006-05-31 16:05  zmoelnig

	* cancel pending destroy-requests on "create"

2006-05-31 15:54  zmoelnig

	* reschedule a rendering-cycle when changing the framerate from 0.0
	  to something valid (normally the framerate change only takes
	  effect at the next render-cycle; with framerate==0.0 this can
	  take a long time)

2006-05-24 19:18  cclepper

	* added defines for Intel.

2006-05-24 19:17  cclepper

	* added defines for Intel.  fixed stupid looping bug.

2006-05-16 14:00  zmoelnig

	* changed the return type of string.find() from (size_t) to
	  (unsigned long) in order to make a valid test for (pos<0): this
	  prevents hanging...

2006-05-07 12:04  zmoelnig

	* use (size_t) where appropriate

2006-05-07 12:03  zmoelnig

	* made m_size of type (size_t) instead of just (int)

2006-05-07 12:03  zmoelnig

	* include <stdio.h>

2006-05-07 12:00  zmoelnig

	* explicit casts to (float) to shut up warnings

2006-05-07 11:58  zmoelnig

	* made m_size of type (size_t) instead of just (int)

2006-05-04 21:04  zmoelnig

	* respect m_size (via glScale() and glPush/glPop)

2006-05-04 20:54  zmoelnig

	* use GemMan::destroyWindowSoon() for window destruction: this
	  allows to directly connect [gemmouse] to [destroy( without
	  crashing (previously a [del 0] was needed to decouple the
	  window-event-grabbing from the window-destruction)

2006-05-04 20:52  zmoelnig

	* added a destroyWindowSoon() function that issues a delayed
	  windows destruction (destruction is done at the beginning of the
	  next render cycle which is rescheduled to be within 0.0 ms); this
	  is useful when the destruction is initiated via window-events
	  which would otherwise crash pd

2006-05-04 19:53  zmoelnig

	* the slice-input now also accepts a pair of numbers for different
	  numSlices and numStacks; currently only used by [sphere3d]

2006-05-04 19:43  zmoelnig

	* added a spherical object for deformation (similar to [curve3d],
	  but only control-points for now

2006-05-03 15:34  zmoelnig

	* fixed memory-leak

2006-05-03 06:24  tigital

	* now we correctly get the location of uniform variables:  how it
	  worked before, I have no idea...

2006-04-28 16:34  zmoelnig

	* use memset() instead of bzero(); use __WIN32__ instead of WIN32;
	  include config.h for this to work

2006-04-28 16:33  zmoelnig

	* inlcude config.h for __WIN32__

2006-04-28 16:18  zmoelnig

	* include <io.h> instead of <unistd.h> on w32

2006-04-28 16:16  zmoelnig

	* just include CPPExtern.h: this will include m_pd.h, so we don't
	  need to do it here

2006-04-28 16:13  zmoelnig

	* include GemExportDef before m_pd.h: this way we only have to
	  pragma-disable the vc-warnings once: less code cluttering!

2006-04-28 16:12  zmoelnig

	* use _MSC_VER instead of __WIN32__ for w32-specific things (the
	  used pragmas are vc-only; i am not that sure about the
	  declspec()-things)

2006-04-28 15:57  zmoelnig

	* moved all includes to top of the file; use GemGL.h to include the
	  gl-headers

2006-04-28 15:51  zmoelnig

	* added wglext.h for w32; shouldn't the agl-headers be included
	  here too?

2006-04-28 15:35  zmoelnig

	* automatically define __WIN32__ if _MSC_VER is defined

2006-04-28 15:33  zmoelnig

	* removed test for GL_WIN32_MEAN_AND_LEAN  (there is no such thing)

2006-04-28 15:32  zmoelnig

	* use "#ifdef __WIN32__" instead of "#if __WIN32__"

2006-04-28 15:30  zmoelnig

	* protected the use of defines via #ifdef; better bracketing;

2006-04-28 15:29  zmoelnig

	* don't use freeShm() on __WIN32__

2006-04-28 15:29  zmoelnig

	* protected the use of defines via #ifdef

2006-04-28 15:27  zmoelnig

	* use HAVE_QUICKTIME (and added a not about where it should be
	  defined properly)

2006-04-28 15:26  zmoelnig

	* use double for sqrt()

2006-04-28 15:24  zmoelnig

	* on w32 include <io.h>  instead of <unistd.h>

2006-04-28 15:22  zmoelnig

	* check if GL_TEXTURE0_ARB is defined before using it

2006-04-27 14:35  zmoelnig

	* it has been a long time since i compiled that...fixed some minor
	  typos...

2006-04-27 14:07  zmoelnig

	* added checks for video4linux-2; this is disabled by default
	  (enable it with "--with-v4l2")

2006-04-27 13:21  zmoelnig

	* added the bug reported by cyrille regarding pix_video and philips
	  webcams

2006-04-26 17:37  zmoelnig

	* fixed the [vertex_program]-bug; opened the freeframe-64bit issue

2006-04-26 17:34  zmoelnig

	* made "param" an alias for "parameter", since this is the keyword
	  most objects use...

2006-04-26 17:33  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug where m_envNum was not properly initialized when
	  [vertex_program] was called with an argument; moved "parameter"
	  to vertex_program.cpp, so both objects can set the parameter;
	  LATER think about multiple parameters...

2006-04-26 14:22  zmoelnig

	* proper initialization prevents crashes in destructor...

2006-04-26 11:35  zmoelnig

	* did some proper initializing of pointers to prevent crashes (why
	  has nobody thought about that in the generation process!??)

2006-04-26 10:30  zmoelnig

	* trigger the quitting from outside (that is: the script)

2006-04-26 10:20  zmoelnig

	* a simple test that tests for all Gem objects (as listed in
	  objects.txt); no tests are performed on vertex/-objects and on
	  markEx/-objects

2006-04-26 09:47  zmoelnig

	* fixed the [separator] bug; found other ways to trigger the
	  [vertex_program] bug

2006-04-26 09:41  zmoelnig

	* before pushing to the stacks, check whether the stacks are
	  already full; this leads to less errors when chaining more than 1
	  [separator]

2006-04-26 09:40  zmoelnig

	* added a variable for the current depth of the matrix-stacks

2006-04-26 09:39  zmoelnig

	* query the number of supported stacks for the various matrix-modes
	  (important for [separator]; text whether
	  GL_NV_multisample_texture_hint is supported before setting the
	  hint;

2006-04-25 19:18  zmoelnig

	* normalized input and output values; still no clamping

2006-04-25 18:58  zmoelnig

	* yuv2rgb and vice versa conversion abstractions

2006-04-24 21:16  zmoelnig

	* use "size_t" for alignment-magic, since
	  sizeof(int)!=sizeof(unsigned char*) on x86_64; btw, this should
	  be used in pd's m_simd.h and in the freeframe specs too...

2006-04-11 11:33  zmoelnig

	* moved the window-destruction in render() before the m_windowState
	  check: this fixes issues with lights when destroying the windows
	  from "outside"

2006-04-07 17:12  tigital

	* [osx] uyvy/bgra/yv12 conversions altivec'd (DONE)

2006-04-07 05:49  tigital

	* yuv422_to_bgra_altivec() now works; fixed some typos;
	  re-corrected #include's

2006-04-05 13:29  zmoelnig

	* removed this pseudo-configure script since it is totally
	  outdated; the (pseudo) Makefile in here should call configure in
	  src/ if needed

2006-04-05 13:27  zmoelnig

	* removed the call to glClearColor() in the reset()-routine since
	  it might crash pd/Gem when no valid context is available (LATER:
	  think what will happen when someone clicks on "reset" while
	  rendering)

2006-03-28 11:40  zmoelnig

	* reverted the include-change by jamie.  this should really be
	  handled by configure and NOT in here since we don't know whether
	  the quicktime-headers are in lqt/ or quicktime/ or...

2006-03-28 05:20  tigital

	* fixed header inclusion

2006-03-27 18:46  tigital

	* CLAMP() is inlined from GemFuncUtil.h

2006-03-27 16:48  zmoelnig

	* replaced "nil" by "null64" in MMX routines, since this makes
	  problems with QuickTime-framework (on macintel)

2006-03-27 16:47  zmoelnig

	* added SSE2 processing for YUV (but most of the time is spent in
	  memory-fetching anyhow, so not much of a speed gain)

2006-03-27 09:52  zmoelnig

	* updated TODO-list: opened new bugs for [separator], missing
	  objects on w32, and the shader-objects

2006-03-24 16:16  zmoelnig

	* initialize (and modify) m_simd via GemSIMD and select optimized
	  algorithms at runtime.

2006-03-24 16:12  zmoelnig

	* instantiate a GemSIMD class in order to  query the CPU only once.

2006-03-24 16:10  zmoelnig

	* implemented a small static class GemSIMD which is used to query
	  the SIMD-capabilities of the current CPUs: this should bring us
	  away from (not) using SIMD via preprocessors.

2006-03-24 00:08  zmoelnig

	* weird: compiling with SSE2 (on a system that doesn't support
	  it!), yields to crashes when casting "double" to "int"; using
	  "float" works fine, so i enforced floats here...

2006-03-23 23:51  zmoelnig

	* removed "done..." printout in destructor

2006-03-23 18:07  zmoelnig

	* added check for sse2

2006-03-23 18:05  zmoelnig

	* added YUV->RGB24 routine (its not really faster than YUV->RGB32)

2006-03-23 18:03  zmoelnig

	* put GEM_VECTORALIGNMENT in here

2006-03-23 15:25  zmoelnig

	* further improved the SSE2-code: less shuffling done (in YUV2RGBA)
	  and cache optimization on writing

2006-03-23 15:07  zmoelnig

	* use macros for the timing code: this makes things much more
	  readable (no more ifdef's within the actual code to time)

2006-03-23 00:07  tigital

	* typo with no effect

2006-03-23 00:06  tigital

	* var initializing re-ordering

2006-03-22 23:50  tigital

	* added "#ifdef GL_ARB_shader_objects" to linkCallback()

2006-03-22 23:47  tigital

	* added YUV422_to_YV12_altivec(); changed function var's to
	  YV12_to_YUV422_altivec() so it works in the new file; started
	  YUV422_to_BGRA_altivec(), but non-functioning atm

2006-03-22 23:43  tigital

	* re-ordering

2006-03-22 23:40  tigital

	* GemPixConvert.h switcheroo

2006-03-22 18:41  zmoelnig

	* use the YUV2RGBA routines; on reallocate() make sure that a
	  pointer to the aligned memory is returned

2006-03-22 18:35  zmoelnig

	* initial SSE2-optimized YUV2RGBA conversion: there is still a lot
	  to be done here (e.g. get a real grip on SIMD-programming!)

2006-03-22 13:59  zmoelnig

	* added SSE2-optimized RGBA2YUV conversion; since GemPixUtil.cpp
	  has grownso huge, i have outsourced the optimized color
	  conversion routines into separate files GemPixConvertAltivec.cpp,
	  GemPixConvertSSE2.cpp; obviously this has only been tested on
	  linux and mightwork (or not) on osx

2006-03-20 22:32  zmoelnig

	* did i check this in already?

2006-03-20 21:53  zmoelnig

	* a toon-shader done with glsl

2006-03-20 16:02  tigital

	* "#ifdef GL_ARB_shader_objects" added to createArrays()

2006-03-19 19:25  zmoelnig

	* i think the separator-issue is almost fixed

2006-03-19 19:25  tigital

	* remembered to member variables (masses, springs), so now we have
	  actual object autonomy

2006-03-18 21:36  tigital

	* fixed typo, now compiles

2006-03-18 15:21  zmoelnig

	* in theory these changes should fix the memleak problem with the
	  [separator]: while i was extra careful, i hope that my changes
	  will be compiling and (what's more) be functional on other
	  platforms!

2006-03-16 10:34  zmoelnig

	* updated help-patches (mostly xchanged the [destroy( message with
	  [create()

2006-03-16 09:55  zmoelnig

	* FIXED: not using client-storage on machines that do not support
	  it led to a "invalid enumerant" GL-error (due to setting
	  GL_UNPACK_CLIENT_STORAGE_APPLE via glPixelStore to _some_ value);

2006-03-15 20:49  tigital

	* updated based on what was committed yesterday, plus some other
	  things

2006-03-15 18:09  zmoelnig

	* updated since a help-patch for [pix_record] is now available

2006-03-15 17:51  zmoelnig

	* new implementation that allows switching of the attached
	  shm-segment via a "set" message.

2006-03-15 16:42  zmoelnig

	* things removed for osX needed to be removed on linux too

2006-03-15 11:37  zmoelnig

	* a help-patch

2006-03-15 11:35  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up a bit (less verbosity; local variables should not be
	  called m_...; ...)

2006-03-14 21:04  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()...also initial code
	  (not fully working) intended to allow auto-texcoord generation
	  and setTexCoords()

2006-03-14 20:59  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()...also changed to
	  GL_NEAREST filtering to prevent fallback to software
	  renderer...and initial (not fully working) code to allow
	  colorspace request (ie. FLOAT, RGB, RGBA)

2006-03-14 20:53  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()

2006-03-14 20:49  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()

2006-03-14 20:25  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()

2006-03-14 20:17  tigital

	* [osx]: removed HaveValidContext() checks, because we now have a
	  master context created via GemMan::initGem()

2006-03-14 19:23  tigital

	* corrected path to initial image

2006-03-14 16:35  zmoelnig

	* glsl_vertex and glsl_fragment now respect pd's search path;
	  updated TODO since some help-patches are now done

2006-03-14 16:32  zmoelnig

	* updated and new help-patches for shaders

2006-03-14 15:25  tigital

	* [size $1< works, and it's centered; removed CLIP_* limitations,
	  so now it's like a normal gem object;  some cleanup

2006-03-14 15:20  tigital

	* added setModified() to parmMess:  where is this really necessary
	  (and not)?

2006-03-14 15:19  zmoelnig

	* link now optionally takes a list of module-id's: [link 3 2( is
	  the same as [shader 3 2, link(

2006-03-14 15:17  zmoelnig

	* repsect pd's search path when opening shaders; fewer openGL
	  errors;

2006-03-14 15:17  tigital

	* cleanup:  removed unused function bindTexture()

2006-03-14 14:20  zmoelnig

	* removed printout of plugin address; made param# larger and end
	  the param-string with \0

2006-03-14 14:18  zmoelnig

	* added help-files for ARB shaders; made the [pix_freeframe] object
	  theoretically functional

2006-03-14 13:33  zmoelnig

	* empty(!still!) class for a splash screen; this object is aliased
	  "Gem", so that when people create a [Gem] object, it doesn't fail

2006-03-14 11:40  zmoelnig

	* mark shm-segment for deletion when object is destroyed; [TODO]:
	  marked pix_share_* as done

2006-03-14 11:38  zmoelnig

	* added help patches

2006-03-14 11:14  zmoelnig

	* made it work on linux (even without crashes!); now you can also
	  specify the 4th argument (color) as symbolic name like "RGBA" or
	  "YUV":

2006-03-14 09:58  zmoelnig

	* updated status

2006-03-14 09:53  zmoelnig

	* what we still have to-do to make the gem-0.91 release

2006-03-13 21:27  zmoelnig

	* added a handle for Destroy-Event on linux; whenever the window is
	  closed (by clicking on the "x") the gem-context will be
	  destroyed; this needs to be done outside of the event-loop to
	  avoid crashes

2006-03-13 20:38  zmoelnig

	* convert from cs other than RGBA

2006-03-13 18:47  zmoelnig

	* registered the WM_DELETE_WINDOW protocol in order to disable the
	  user-closing of the Window: LATER think about closing the window,
	  when the user requests it.

2006-03-13 18:20  zmoelnig

	* respect the upside-down flag when in mem2jpegImage(): however on
	  my machine the images written seem to be correct anyhow...

2006-03-13 17:56  zmoelnig

	* do not instantiate recordQT4L when HAVE_LQT_ADD_VIDEO_TRACK is
	  not defined

2006-03-12 21:37  zmoelnig

	* added help-patches for the hsv2rgb (and vice versa) abstraction:
	  these are just copies from Gem/help/

2006-03-12 21:34  zmoelnig

	* new abstractions in case we get rid of MarkEx

2006-03-12 20:33  zmoelnig

	* added new help-file

2006-03-12 20:07  zmoelnig

	* new help-files

2006-03-06 12:23  zmoelnig

	* added stencil-buffer for glx (tested) and wgl (NOT tested)

2006-03-04 01:52  tigital

	* added stencil buffer on creation

2006-03-03 21:42  tigital

	* added env message; cleanups in setUpTextureState()

2006-03-02 15:55  zmoelnig

	* set "upsidedown" to false: while this is the default on most
	  systems, it is not on OSX (where quicktime makes flipped images);
	  however pix_snap will always make "upright" images, so we have to
	  make sure this is set here; this should close #1096651 at the
	  sf-tracker (but i haven't tested it on OSX) additionally use
	  setCsizeByFormat(); additionally enable the __APPLE__'ed code for
	  all platforms (its nothing apple-specific in there)

2006-02-28 18:40  zmoelnig

	* who need m_name and m_length ? not me...

2006-02-28 18:39  zmoelnig

	* whoa! finally found the bug that made Gem crash on re-loading a
	  shader (or loading another one...); lots of cleanups, like using
	  C++ "new" instead of "malloc" and more terse output and and ...

2006-02-27 17:00  tigital

	* free arrays in getVariables() before getting the new
	  m_uniformCount

2006-02-27 16:09  zmoelnig

	* finally found the type that made a) the object crash and b) it
	  look weird; only regenerate the vertices,... when needed (e.g.
	  something has changed)

2006-02-27 15:25  zmoelnig

	* added better (probably working) tests for ARB and NV extensions

2006-02-27 15:09  zmoelnig

	* added a better (probably working) test for "lqt_add_video_track"

2006-02-27 14:36  zmoelnig

	* added missing curly bracket

2006-02-27 14:35  zmoelnig

	* initialized the index-array to "0": this keeps us from crashing!

2006-02-24 16:14  tigital

	* added messages: "drag"(default 0.5) and "spring" (default 0.3);
	  some cleanup

2006-02-23 18:34  zmoelnig

	* added support for writing specified slots to disk (not very well
	  tested)

2006-02-23 18:33  zmoelnig

	* support for other colorspaces than RGB when writing with
	  imagemagick (YUV not yet supported; libtiff and libjpeg not
	  tested at all!)

2006-02-23 16:33  zmoelnig

	* only compile if HAVE_LQT_ADD_VIDEO_TRACKS is defined (which
	  should be defined by configure)

2006-02-23 16:29  zmoelnig

	* removed the inlet

2006-02-23 16:29  zmoelnig

	* allow to set the class-flags by defining GEM_CLASSFLAGS

2006-02-21 15:01  zmoelnig

	* define HAVE_CONFIG_GENERIC_H if we don't have another
	  config*.h.in file

2006-02-21 15:00  zmoelnig

	* include configGeneric.h instead of os-specific config-file if
	  HAVE_CONFIG_GENERIC_H is defined (at the command line)

2006-02-21 14:27  zmoelnig

	* a generic fallback (a la long we can replace all the os-specific
	  config.h.in files)

2006-02-21 14:25  zmoelnig

	* added a test for lqt_add_video_track()

2006-02-21 14:01  zmoelnig

	* added HAVE_LQT_ADD_VIDEO_TRACK, since older versions of
	  libquicktime don't have this...

2006-02-21 12:05  zmoelnig

	* tried to make it more stable; it is till crashing when: a)
	  switching from non-texture to texture (it works when the texture
	  is present when rendering is started); b) switching the
	  lighting-state

2006-02-21 12:02  zmoelnig

	* #ifdef'ed everything with USE_GLEW (currently glew is not used,
	  so try to avoid any interference)

2006-02-17 06:22  tigital

	* removed an unused outlet

2006-02-16 20:53  tigital

	* useful for automatic texture-coordinate generation

2006-02-16 00:05  tigital

	* [osx] one last hack to make it work like the other platforms

2006-02-15 21:54  zmoelnig

	* oops! for testing i used __linux__ instead of __APPLE__ and
	  forgot to revert it...

2006-02-15 21:34  zmoelnig

	* some string magic to get the correct name of the plugin within an
	  osX-bundle

2006-02-15 19:32  zmoelnig

	* fixed use of DONT_HAVE_GLBLENDEQUATION (it was used as
	  HAVE_GLBLENDEQUATION)

2006-02-13 22:49  zmoelnig

	* removed the 2nd inlet (why was it there at all?)

2006-02-13 17:58  tigital

	* corrected all.trees path to work from help

2006-02-10 16:20  zmoelnig

	* use MAKECMDGOALS when calling the Makefile in src/

2006-02-10 14:32  zmoelnig

	* added inlets for contrast and saturation

2006-02-10 14:26  zmoelnig

	* added Grayscale processing avoid processing in [pix_contrast] if
	  both m_contrast and m_saturate are 1.f (in greyscale ignore
	  m_saturate)

2006-02-09 01:32  tigital

	* [osx] new loader code that works with freeframe 1.0 SDK; note
	  that the plugin will be looked for in the same directory as the
	  patch, and currently you must append ".frf" to the end of the
	  plugin's name

2006-02-08 23:39  tigital

	* cleaned up imageStruct::setCsizeByFormat() so that it no longer
	  does "default" switch before hitting the various case's

2006-02-08 23:27  cclepper

	* Added RGBA version and tested on Windows.

2006-02-08 23:26  cclepper

	* Added RGBA version and tested on Windows.  Works except for
	  negative contrasrt and saturarion values.

2006-02-07 17:16  zmoelnig

	* renamed processYUV_Altivec() to processYUVAltivec() so it gets
	  automatically called by GemPixObj's render(); put initializing of
	  class-variables into the constructor-header

2006-02-07 04:34  cclepper

	* added #ifdef __VEC__

2006-02-07 04:30  cclepper

	* added #ifdef __VEC__

2006-02-06 22:46  cclepper

	* initial YUV version with Altivec

2006-02-06 18:20  cclepper

	* brings the old pix_record up to date

2006-02-06 15:14  zmoelnig

	* implemented the setCodec(int) as a no-op

2006-02-06 14:41  zmoelnig

	* better indentation to see what is included when

2006-02-06 11:15  zmoelnig

	* this is the original pix_record, now renamed to pix_recordQT
	  while we have the two concurrent objects, how should we make this
	  compatible? create an abstraction?? make hacks like in
	  [pix_filmNT]???

2006-02-06 10:58  zmoelnig

	* at least made it compile on os-x

2006-02-05 20:23  zmoelnig

	* made "record"-message work again

2006-02-05 20:22  zmoelnig

	* now it produces something...

2006-02-05 19:51  zmoelnig

	* updated to use lqt-api instead of old quicktime4linux api.
	  although it somehow produces just noise right now (but hey - it
	  did work 10 minutes ago)

2006-02-05 19:49  zmoelnig

	* removed the dummy implementation of putFrame(): it is pure
	  virtual in record.cpp and should not be filled with dummies

2006-02-04 19:16  tigital

	* update

2006-02-04 13:47  zmoelnig

	* define HAVE_QUICKTIME for __APPLE__ (later think about using
	  autoconf for this)

2006-02-04 13:44  zmoelnig

	* added convertTo() and convertFrom() functions to the
	  imageStruct-class for generic cs-conversion.

2006-02-03 22:53  zmoelnig

	* pix_record which is independent of the used API (like
	  pix_filmNEW,...)

2006-02-03 22:52  zmoelnig

	* blind fixes to match record.h

2006-02-03 22:40  zmoelnig

	* implementation classes for pix-record APIs.  so far the
	  recordQT4L (quicktime-for-linux) is tested, but not totally
	  stable the recordQT (Apple's QuickTime API) has been
	  copy'n'pasted from the original pix_record.cpp code - i am pretty
	  sure i introduced some problems: at least the codec-querying and
	  (more important) setting has certainly been broken.

2006-02-03 16:33  tigital

	* [osx]: shutup gcc warning in initGem()

2006-02-01 19:38  zmoelnig

	* replaced printf() by error() (it's more pdish and doesn't throw
	  an error)

2006-02-01 19:37  zmoelnig

	* at least it compiles here on linux...

2006-02-01 19:21  zmoelnig

	* probably a new-line at EOF

2006-02-01 19:21  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up code a bit (so i can read it :-)) should perform a bit
	  faster as well fixed a crash on my machine added type message

	  still very crashy i _think_ there is a bug (most likely: a memory
	  leak) in here

2006-02-01 17:53  tigital

	* forgot header change to other platforms:  this'll be cleaned and
	  put in the correct spot (ie. the top of the file) sometime

2006-02-01 16:43  tigital

	* initial commit:  novel mathematical structure

2006-02-01 16:42  tigital

	* initial commit:  takes an image and creates a "voronoi region"
	  painting out of it...works on OSX, but relies on GemPBuffer code,
	  so other platforms can use this to test that code...

2006-02-01 16:39  tigital

	* initial commit:  works on OSX (still needs some serious
	  cleanup!), but untested on other platforms:  code is there, but
	  is it really equivalently functional?

2006-02-01 16:37  tigital

	* added check for a loaded program to the paramMess code; prevents
	  crashing when sending parameters to the object but no program is
	  actually loaded!

2006-02-01 16:36  tigital

	* error code reporting cleanup

2006-02-01 16:34  tigital

	* [OSX] changed NULL to 0 to shutup gcc

2006-02-01 16:33  tigital

	* added header for glReportError(); [OSX] added "masterContext"

2006-02-01 16:31  tigital

	* cleanup; added setModified();

2006-02-01 16:04  zmoelnig

	* changed "#define unix" to "#define __unix__"

2006-02-01 16:03  zmoelnig

	* changed "#define unix" to "#define __unix__" removed unneccessary
	  headers from inclusion

2006-02-01 15:59  zmoelnig

	* changed "#define unix" to "#define __unix__" moved the check for
	  glx-support to GemWinCreateXWin.h

2006-02-01 15:58  tigital

	* [OSX] added "masterContext", which gets rid of need for
	  HaveValidContext()...needs non-jamie testing ;-)

2006-02-01 15:53  tigital

	* cleanups; added TODO questions; [OSX] added "masterContext",
	  which gets rid of need for HaveValidContext()...needs non-jamie
	  testing ;-)

2006-02-01 14:24  zmoelnig

	* only create constContext when its not already created

2006-02-01 14:23  zmoelnig

	* applied patch from cesare to avoid crashes on closing the window

2006-01-30 14:12  zmoelnig

	* added constructor for pixBlock-class (which properly initalizes
	  newfilm and newimage to "false") moved constructor/destructor of
	  imageStruct and pixBlock from header into the cpp-files to avoid
	  unneccessary recompilation on changes)

2006-01-26 15:47  zmoelnig

	* made a script (which will hopefully hardly ever be needed) to
	  import glew mention it in the README.glew

2006-01-26 15:07  zmoelnig

	* added glew-files (+ a readme how i got them)

2006-01-23 12:08  zmoelnig

	* changed [part_velsphere] to [part_velocity sphere]

2006-01-23 12:07  zmoelnig

	* define DONT_HAVE_GLBLENDQUATION

	  i think, this file should be used only for M$VC; LATER we can put
	  #pragma's in here to enable linking with special libraries based
	  on the configuration (or should we rather do it in the files that
	  need these libraries??)

2006-01-23 12:05  zmoelnig

	* use a DONT_HAVE_GLBLENDQUATION rather than __WIN32__ to determine
	  whether this objects needs to be disabled

2006-01-22 22:43  zmoelnig

	* added alternative dependencies for magick++6 and avifile-0.7

2006-01-22 22:41  zmoelnig

	* added newly added files

2006-01-22 22:40  zmoelnig

	* minor changes (line.breaks)

2006-01-22 22:37  zmoelnig

	* on w32 we have to include <io.h> to be able to use "close(int)"

2006-01-22 22:32  zmoelnig

	* fixed string-template issues with vc6

2006-01-22 22:29  zmoelnig

	* changed 0.5 to 0.5f to make floats instead of doubles (amd thus
	  reduce warnings about conversion)

2006-01-22 22:27  zmoelnig

	* disabled if GL_TEXTURE0_ARB is undefined (another candidate for
	  GLEW)

2006-01-22 22:26  zmoelnig

	* removed definition of DEBUG=0 since it is not needed anyhow

2006-01-22 22:25  zmoelnig

	* turn glBlendEquation OFF on w32 (stupid restriction, but faster
	  than finding anything more sophisticated)

2006-01-22 22:23  zmoelnig

	* only set glParameterEnvArg if vertexprograms are supported by the
	  headers

2006-01-22 22:17  zmoelnig

	* disable more warnings (here: switch-statement without case (only
	  default); this is possible is all cases are turned off by
	  #ifdefs)

	  NOTE: these pragmas should be within __MSC_VER_ instead of
	  __WIN32__

2006-01-18 13:10  zmoelnig

	* found this lying around on my harddisk

2006-01-18 12:22  zmoelnig

	* made circle::NUM_PTS a define rather than a const static variable

2006-01-18 12:13  zmoelnig

	* removed unused variables made circle::NUM_PTS a define rather
	  than a const static variable

2006-01-18 11:54  zmoelnig

	* set a variable when an apple-framework is found use it in the
	  status-report (so apple-users don't get confused about no
	  QuickTime even if the framework is installed) in "configure" the
	  removal of "local"/"locale" is also applied

2006-01-18 11:52  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo "locale" should read "local"; however, since the tests
	  are not expanded into functions, this does not work so i removed
	  the "locale" entirely and replaced it by a pseudo-localized
	  variable (appending stuff derived from the arguments)

2006-01-18 11:24  zmoelnig

	* properly ifdef the usage of "kDVCPROHD720pCodecType"

2006-01-18 11:18  zmoelnig

	* declare getFPS() (inherited from film.h)

2006-01-18 11:15  zmoelnig

	* include <fcntl.h> for open()

2006-01-18 11:02  zmoelnig

	* disable more code, if GL_ARB_shader_objects is not defined
	  (mostly cosmetic)

2006-01-18 11:00  zmoelnig

	* disable most of the code if "GL_ARB_shader_objects" is not
	  defined

2006-01-18 10:13  zmoelnig

	* avoid using m_program if "GL_ARB_shader_objects" is not defined

2006-01-17 12:01  zmoelnig

	* prevent ARB-GLSL

2005-12-27 20:03  tigital

	* initial helpfile

2005-12-15 18:45  zmoelnig

	* removed loading/saving removed "point" area-type changed (float)
	  to (unsigned char) where possible (at least where it was obvious
	  to do)

2005-12-15 14:09  zmoelnig

	* updated a bit so we can build a debian-package

2005-12-15 13:17  zmoelnig

	* added davide's hit-object

2005-12-15 11:54  zmoelnig

	* initialized more variables moved initialization (from body of
	  constructor) into initialization-block of constructor

2005-12-15 01:43  tigital

	* clean up in render loop

2005-12-15 00:19  cclepper

	* works on windows. sorta.  only a few changes needed from the mac
	  code.

2005-12-15 00:15  cclepper

	* works on windows. sorta.  only a few changes needed from the mac
	  code.

2005-12-14 16:53  tigital

	* string buffer is now member variable; more detailed reporting
	  when program is outside hardware limits

2005-12-14 14:34  zmoelnig

	* TreeIdMap for reacTable*'s fiducials

2005-12-14 14:29  zmoelnig

	* dont build depend-files when doing "make clean" or "make
	  distclean"

2005-12-14 14:29  zmoelnig

	* don't try to generate configure, Make.config and the like when
	  doing a "make clean" or "make distclean"

2005-12-14 14:28  zmoelnig

	* newline at end of file...

2005-12-14 14:26  zmoelnig

	* fixed header-inclusion-prevention-defines (ye, my mother-tongue
	  is German)

2005-12-14 14:24  zmoelnig

	* included Ross and Martin for the reacTIVision system replaced "@"
	  by "[AT]"

2005-12-14 14:15  zmoelnig

	* help-patches for the fiducial-tracker (and the binarizing
	  thresholder)

2005-12-14 14:14  zmoelnig

	* fiducial-tracking as used in reacTIVision thanks to martin
	  kaltenbrunner and ross bencina (and the mtg@upf) for releasing
	  their code under (L)GPL

2005-12-14 14:13  zmoelnig

	* binarizing adaptive tiled thresholder

2005-12-14 14:07  zmoelnig

	* better check whether switching to another driver succeeds

2005-12-10 20:45  tigital

	* added glReportError() for helping debug

2005-12-10 19:40  zmoelnig

	* moved GLdefine's from GemPixUtil to GemGL

2005-12-10 17:01  tigital

	* corrected spotlight direction initialization; placed limits on
	  light parameters (as supported by GL)

2005-12-10 01:20  tigital

	* removed spurious glEnd() called in createSphere:  it was causing
	  a glError...

2005-12-09 23:52  cclepper

	* added parameter message

2005-12-09 23:49  cclepper

	* added parameter message

2005-12-07 17:40  cclepper

	* fixed QT crashing on Windows, but the fix introduces a small
	  memory leak when loading new movies.	Also, removed a redundant
	  memcpy() in getFrame.

2005-12-07 17:17  tigital

	* - added mode & repeat messages (like [pix_texture], same
	  defaults) - added outlet for texture info:  ID, width, height,
	  type

2005-12-06 07:40  tigital

	* initial commit: - allows offscreen rendering on a per [gemhead]
	  basis - defaults to 256x256, but can be set with [dimen x y< -
	  float RGB only, atm - right outlet outputs list: texID, width,
	  height, type - type can be switched with [mode 0/1< (ie.
	  TEXTURE_2D or TEXTURE_RECTANGLE)

2005-12-06 06:56  tigital

	* renamed inlet for some unknown reason

2005-12-06 05:01  tigital

	* don't need to enable/disable shader_arb; added check and better
	  clean up for re-loaded shaders

2005-12-04 23:45  tigital

	* added outlet for programID

2005-12-04 17:15  tigital

	* useful glWrapper which allows one to use a glsl_program that was
	  linked in an earlier chain in a later chain; but don't forget to
	  frame it's usage with an ending call with value zero, or the
	  program affects all later chains

2005-12-04 02:17  tigital

	* individual shader objects are now responsible for cleaning up
	  after themselves; also, made initialized length=0

2005-12-04 02:13  tigital

	* object is now responsible for cleaning up after itself; also
	  discovered that we don't need to glEnable the *_SHADER_ARB's

2005-11-30 07:55  tigital

	* auto-magic uniform variable discovery working; shaderMess()
	  fixes; lotsa cleanup in general (& stuff)

2005-11-30 01:12  tigital

	* clean-up, & better initialization

2005-11-30 00:55  tigital

	* corrected shaderMess behavior; added OSX check for
	  hardware/software execution

2005-11-29 05:52  tigital

	* miscellaneous fixes of warnings, misspellings, and debug messages

2005-11-29 00:29  cclepper

	* added SequenceGrabber recording

2005-11-27 15:30  zmoelnig

	* thread fixes: + better initializing + more freeing + filenames
	  given as argument are now opened via thread too

2005-11-27 11:24  zmoelnig

	* reduced verbosity a bit made rest of error messages a bit more
	  findable ("error: GemImageLoad" instead of just "erro: GEM")

2005-11-26 22:17  zmoelnig

	* added dynamic methods for uniform parameters

2005-11-26 20:13  cclepper

	* Added the first check for HD format clips to deal with their
	  trickster frame sizes.  Also, a fix for sound continuing after
	  rendering stops.

2005-11-26 17:19  zmoelnig

	* use a #define for defining the max number of shaders fixed some
	  typos and minor bugs

2005-11-26 16:36  zmoelnig

	* on creating the child-thread wait until it has set the
	  m_thread_running (so we can use that in openMess())

2005-11-26 14:12  zmoelnig

	* reduced verbosity

2005-11-26 13:48  zmoelnig

	* hmm: define "t_GLshaderObj" to whatever type the shaderobj should
	  be; made it compile on linux (and not crash)

2005-11-26 13:45  zmoelnig

	* include stdlib (for malloc, free) replace printf() by post()

2005-11-26 06:08  cclepper

	* Added the first check for HD format clips to deal with their
	  trickster frame sizes.  Also, a fix for sound continuing after
	  rendering stops.

2005-11-26 01:50  tigital

	* initial wrapper support for GLSL support (ARB based): - there
	  should be a whole host of these, but right now I'm only up to
	  writing the one, for input of one indexed float ;-)

2005-11-25 23:56  tigital

	* initial GLSL support (ARB based): - load individual shaders via
	  glsl_vertex or glsl_fragment - combine multiple shader's right
	  output into a [shader $1 $2...< and send into [glsl_program] -
	  send [link< to [glsl_program] to actually link the objects:  this
	  was done because we don't want to re-link objects every
	  render-timeslice...  - each object accepts a [print< to give
	  info, , and [glsl_program] will also report linked program's
	  uniform variables, names, indices...	- uniform variable indices
	  can be used with [GEMglUniform...] to change variables (but maybe
	  there should be more auto-discovery in [glsl_program]?) -
	  object's will also report a shader's compile-time error log (if
	  any) to console (not pd's tk console):  need to figure out how to
	  parse infolog into post()-friendly format...

2005-11-23 14:08  zmoelnig

	* added check for GLsizeiptrARB

2005-11-23 14:07  zmoelnig

	* die at the end of configure if no openGL has been found check for
	  typedef of GLsizeiptrARB

2005-11-21 15:31  zmoelnig

	* threaded image loading

2005-11-15 15:24  zmoelnig

	* updated help-files

2005-11-15 15:22  zmoelnig

	* show how to load an image into the buffer

2005-11-15 15:21  zmoelnig

	* added some more wrappers (thanks to cyrille)

2005-11-10 15:50  zmoelnig

	* initialize m_devicename to NULL in order to not produce random
	  crashes.  fixed printf() security-hole

2005-11-09 04:08  tigital

	* cleaned up headers, initialization; also added code to pad
	  rowbytes for dimensions not multitples of 16 or 32 (helps
	  GL_STORAGE_SHARED_APPLE)

2005-11-09 00:01  cclepper

	* added a little hack to bang when film reaches the end in auto
	  mode

2005-10-31 17:04  tigital

	* update

2005-10-28 10:59  zmoelnig

	* use proper inheritance for the altivec function

2005-10-28 00:13  tigital

	* added imageStruct.fromGray( short*) version, so now we can import
	  luminance images from pdp2gem...

2005-10-27 23:30  cclepper

	* added Altivec YUV function

2005-10-26 15:54  zmoelnig

	* fixed path and case of images to load

2005-10-25 22:37  cclepper

	* commented out lines in postrender which removes memory leak in
	  [separator]

2005-10-25 12:01  zmoelnig

	* throw an exception when no texture-units are defined at startup
	  time (prevents object-creation) enforce 2 arguments in the
	  texUnit-message

2005-10-25 11:54  zmoelnig

	* bugfix: added A_NULL as terminating argument to the
	  texUnit-callback

2005-10-22 22:50  tigital

	* GL_VERSION_1_1 check only (there's no GL_VERSION_1_0_ on osx!)

2005-10-21 14:49  zmoelnig

	* improved threaded movie-player: use select() instead of usleep()
	  (should be more portable) when the grabThread returns no frame
	  (NULL), a "bang" is emitted at render-time. the user gets a
	  chance to immediately react on that and reset the frame# to
	  something valid.  when threaded, this will force the changed
	  frame to be read in the main-thread (luckily the grabthread is
	  locked by the mutex)

2005-10-21 10:55  zmoelnig

	* changes in configure.ac

2005-10-21 10:55  zmoelnig

	* check whether ffmpeg's (AVStream)->codec is of type
	  "AVCodecContext" or "*AVCodecContext"

2005-10-21 10:03  zmoelnig

	* removed contents of src/Gnu (since people keep building Gem from
	  there)

2005-10-20 18:03  zmoelnig

	* check for posix-threads removed HAVE_SIMD things (as we should
	  rather use the __MMX__,... that are autodefined by the compiler)

2005-10-20 18:02  zmoelnig

	* check for posixthreads (as in pd)

2005-10-20 15:41  zmoelnig

	* (optional) threaded reading of movies

2005-10-20 15:38  zmoelnig

	* shut up compiler warnings; explicit casts from t_float to GLint

2005-10-20 12:03  zmoelnig

	* added method for "device" with symbolic device-names

2005-10-20 11:59  zmoelnig

	* 2 lines of  comment...

2005-10-20 11:53  zmoelnig

	* fixed docu-bug that led people to try to compile Gem from src/Gnu
	  instead of src/

2005-10-19 14:48  tigital

	* initial commit: - accepts a creation arg to set # of texture
	  units to deal with, or it defaults to the maximum # on the card -
	  [texUnit 1 $2< assigns to texture Unit 1 the texID input via $2 -
	  [mode 0/1< switches between TEXTURE_RECTANGLE and TEXTURE_2D

2005-10-19 01:59  tigital

	* more GLdefine's for multitexture and combiners...

2005-10-14 09:54  zmoelnig

	* disabled warnings on __WIN32__

2005-10-08 18:24  zmoelnig

	* wow! this file has been unused for quite a long time now; since i
	  cannot find any reference to it anywhere (except in the 1.1.1.1
	  or so revision of papi.h) i delete it.

2005-10-07 19:03  zmoelnig

	* removed the disabling of the entire code when FILM_NEW is defined
	  (oh this is really ugly)

2005-10-07 19:02  zmoelnig

	* enabled the weird hack i made for a current CVS snapshot of
	  ffmpeg, since the debian/sid package now uses the new API

2005-10-07 18:53  zmoelnig

	* remove "-f" (less errors if files are already removed)

2005-10-07 18:52  zmoelnig

	* updated w32 compile environment

2005-10-07 18:51  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2005-10-07 18:50  zmoelnig

	* only cimpileif we don't want FILM_NEW (i got an error when
	  compiling in the vfw.h file and i didn't want to fix it in a
	  deprecated file); LATER remove these files

2005-10-07 18:49  zmoelnig

	* no shared memory (via shm) on w32; disabled on that platform

2005-10-07 18:47  zmoelnig

	* defined pragmas to make compiler a bit less verbose

2005-10-07 18:47  zmoelnig

	* hacked together a version of drand48(); how comes drand48() does
	  not exist on w32 even though these files are in here for years ?
	  (LATER)

2005-10-07 18:44  zmoelnig

	* defined pragmas (on w32) to shut up compiler warnings (e.g.
	  because of unknown pragmas)

2005-10-07 18:43  zmoelnig

	* on w32 GL_ARB_fragment_program mightbe defined even if there is
	  no ARB-program support...(we really should switch to glew)

2005-10-07 18:42  zmoelnig

	* include <iostream> instead of <iostream.h> even on w32 (to use
	  the "new" stdlib)

2005-10-06 11:25  zmoelnig

	* merged with SIMD: don't copy the "datasize" with copy2imageStruct
	  - as it should only be used internally for pdata; (there is a
	  captialized warning about breaking things in the SIMD-branch log
	  about this; however, i don't believe that it is that dangerous)

2005-10-05 18:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2005-10-05 18:22  zmoelnig

	* merged with SIMD-branch

2005-10-05 18:14  zmoelnig

	* merged with SIMD

2005-10-05 18:02  zmoelnig

	* merged in changes from SIMD-branch

2005-10-05 17:42  zmoelnig

	* updated

2005-10-05 17:35  zmoelnig

	* changes from configure.ac

2005-10-05 17:22  zmoelnig

	* remove depend-files when "clean"

2005-10-05 17:14  zmoelnig

	* propery escaped test-string

2005-10-05 16:45  zmoelnig

	* use the CXX provided by configure

2005-10-05 16:38  zmoelnig

	* use AC_CHECK_FUNC rather than AC_CHECK_LIB to check for
	  glBindProgram{NV,ARB} since on osX we don't have a library libGL
	  but rather use the OpenGL-framework

	  NOTE: the test for glBindProgramNV fails to detect the
	  nvidia-extensions on osX why ? because you have to explicitely
	  request them by defining GL_NV_vertex_program before including
	  the glext.h file on osX on linux (mesaGL,...) it is different:
	  the extensions are only included, if GL_NV_vertex_program is NOT
	  already defined

2005-10-05 16:14  zmoelnig

	* a compile on osX revealed that somewhere MIN and MAX are defined
	  as preprocessor directives; this stopped compiling the inline
	  functions with the same name; FIXED

2005-10-03 22:19  cclepper

	* initial commit.  object for reading shared pixel memory between
	  processes.

2005-10-03 22:18  cclepper

	* initial commit.  object for creating shared pixel memory between
	  processes.

2005-10-03 14:17  zmoelnig

	* added support for devicenames given as strings (like
	  "/dev/video")

2005-10-03 12:38  zmoelnig

	* removed the caching mechanism; if you want to load a set of
	  images and access from RAM, use [pix_buffer] instead

2005-10-02 18:41  zmoelnig

	* made checking for changes in Base/config`uname -s`.h.in a bit
	  better

2005-10-02 15:52  zmoelnig

	* moved inclusion of openGL-headers to Base/GemGL.h

2005-10-02 15:49  zmoelnig

	* moved inclusion of openGL-headers to Base/GemGL.h

2005-10-02 15:48  zmoelnig

	* removed boolean-hack for buggy nvidia-headers (should get fixed
	  upstream)

2005-10-01 21:31  zmoelnig

	* checking for nvidia-extensions (can be disabled with
	  "--disable-NV")

2005-10-01 21:30  zmoelnig

	* checking for nvidia-extensions (can be disabled with
	  "--disable-NV") added the system-specific config-file to the
	  dependencies to do a ./configure

2005-10-01 21:15  zmoelnig

	* test for definition of GL_{ARB,NV}_{vertex,fragment}_program
	  before using extensions.

2005-10-01 21:14  zmoelnig

	* moved the openGL-magic into Base/GemGL.h

2005-10-01 21:13  zmoelnig

	* moved the inclusion of openGL-headers and the openGL-magic into a
	  separate file GemGL.h (this should be included instead of the
	  system-specific openGL-header files)

2005-09-30 21:25  zmoelnig

	* now we can give the filename as argument and it gets loaded on
	  startRendering() reordered everything a bit (and made
	  fragment_program a child of vertex_program: there's loads of
	  similar code)

2005-09-28 06:29  cclepper

	* made sure glTexSubImage2D is called instead of the power of two
	  texturing

2005-09-27 19:56  zmoelnig

	* a fragment-shader demo that adds some b/w-noise...

2005-09-27 19:55  zmoelnig

	* a fragment shader that produces noise...

2005-09-27 19:04  zmoelnig

	* added vertex_program demo

2005-09-27 19:04  zmoelnig

	* added toon-shader for the vertex_program demo

2005-09-27 19:02  zmoelnig

	* added texture for the vertex_program demo

2005-09-27 18:34  zmoelnig

	* removed the "64 64" arguments to [pix_video] as this makes the
	  patches under windows unusable (pix_videoDS thinks the first
	  argument is the deviceID, not the dimension)

2005-09-27 17:44  zmoelnig

	* leftovers from pre pix_filmNEW aera.	deleted because i don't
	  (want to) maintain this code any more

2005-09-27 17:42  zmoelnig

	* disable if FILM_NEW is defined in Base/config.h (then pix_filmNEW
	  and friends are used)

2005-09-27 07:17  tigital

	* added check for GL_VERSION_1_1, which is the lowest GL_VERSION
	  osx defines

2005-09-27 07:12  tigital

	* added define for GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_EXT, duh

2005-09-26 19:47  zmoelnig

	* [pix_filmFFMPEG] is covered by [pix_filmNEW]+filmFFMPEG

2005-09-26 19:43  zmoelnig

	* made it _compile_ against the current CVS-version of ffmpeg (not
	  really tested whether it works though) you have to actually
	  change an ifdef at the beginning of filmFFMPEG.cpp in order to
	  make it compatible with the CVS-ffmpeg (haven't found out yet,
	  how to do this in a more generic way (apart from hacking
	  configure again) btw, configure would need a lot of tweaking to
	  recognize a current ffmpeg (and link against all the needed
	  libraries) ffmpeg sucks

2005-09-22 19:41  zmoelnig

	* added fix to be able to display floats as numbers again (instead
	  of "float")

2005-09-22 10:32  zmoelnig

	* added moocows changes (+ linebreaking) fixed the bug that
	  prevented TextBase.cpp to build if you were not using FTGL (gltt
	  or no-font)

2005-09-21 20:41  tigital

	* cleanup apple headers

2005-09-21 20:37  tigital

	* reordering to shut up gcc4 warnings

2005-09-21 19:45  tigital

	* #ifdef'ed GLTTPixmapFont *m_afont like in text2d.cpp

2005-09-21 16:56  zmoelnig

	* committed tim's fix to prevent escaping of pd-special characters
	  (like ",")

2005-09-15 12:25  zmoelnig

	* removed the pre-defined maximum of control/grid-points: now we
	  can have curve3d's of any preecision

2005-09-11 18:06  zmoelnig

	* shut up compiler warnings: the changes are mostly removal of
	  unused variables, re-ordering of initialization of
	  member-variables, (un)signedness and proper bracketing when doing
	  comparisions

2005-09-11 18:02  zmoelnig

	* shut up compiler warnings: the changes are mostly removal of
	  unused variables, re-ordering of initialization of
	  member-variables and (un)signedness

2005-09-11 12:29  zmoelnig

	* enable fullscreen on X only if libXxf86vm is present

2005-09-11 12:25  zmoelnig

	* removed a bit of verbosity

2005-09-07 17:42  tigital

	* finally fixed sequence grabber dialog, so now OSX users can
	  select input devices!

2005-09-04 21:35  zmoelnig

	* added multiline-support (for FTGL) based on georg holzmann's code
	  however, multilines have to be broken into lines outside of the
	  [text]-objects; linebreaks are denoted with "\n" (10)

2005-09-04 20:27  zmoelnig

	* initial video4linux-2 support; right now, it seems to be rather
	  slow! a lot of functionality is not implemented yet (like setting
	  the channel)

	  not yet for use!

2005-09-04 20:21  zmoelnig

	* GEM_OBJECTS are now a general {GEM_TARGETS}/*.o rather than each
	  object listed separately (some systems don't support such a long
	  list of arguments)

2005-09-02 23:58  cclepper

	* added loop to match codecType and codec value.  makes pjpeg
	  default work on any machine.

2005-08-31 23:25  cclepper

	* added check for m_haveMovie in setRate to prevent crashing

2005-08-30 18:27  zmoelnig

	* a bit more verbosity on startup, so people will no what to send
	  to "driver"

2005-08-29 04:26  tigital

	* added outlet to output texture ID, which is useful for
	  multitexturing and ARB_programs...

2005-08-27 22:35  zmoelnig

	* maybe a hack to fix the tiny memory leak that i suspect to be in
	  the cache LATER: really fix the cache (or remove it entirely)

2005-08-27 15:12  zmoelnig

	* free image-data when loading (after the image has been copied
	  into the buffer)

2005-08-26 18:40  zmoelnig

	* "binaries" for the latest changes to acinclude.m4 and
	  configure.ac

2005-08-26 18:39  zmoelnig

	* also make a check for package "lqt" (which is libquicktime),
	  since there might be an "lqt"-config installed.

2005-08-26 18:37  zmoelnig

	* (hopefully) even better library checking: if pkg-config cannot
	  find <libname>, we try <libname>-config to get the cflags and
	  libs.

2005-08-26 15:54  zmoelnig

	* test for libquicktime instead of quicktime (there exits a
	  pkg-config for libquicktime on debian) do not automatically add
	  "-lavcodec" when successfully testing for avformat: either the
	  pkg-config test succeeds or the user should really provide
	  PKG_FFMPEG_LIBS to get it right

2005-08-26 15:51  zmoelnig

	* a bit better: if PKG_<libname>_LIBS is defined from outside but
	  pkg-config fails, we do not test with AC_CHECK_PKG but trust the
	  user

2005-08-26 15:50  zmoelnig

	* include <quicktime.h> rather than <quicktime/quicktime.h> the
	  path may change and should be reported by autoconf

2005-08-26 14:31  zmoelnig

	* no freeframe support if sizeof(void*)!=sizeof(unsigned int)

2005-08-26 14:25  zmoelnig

	* added checks for the size of (void*) and (unsigned int) (on
	  x86_64 they are not the same (8 vs 4) and so casts won't work
	  (needed for pix_freeframe)

2005-08-26 14:22  zmoelnig

	* some information on how to workaround to get PIC-versions of
	  certain libraries (ffmpeg, ftgl)

2005-08-26 13:23  zmoelnig

	* forgot to remove update_pix_buffer() remove m_buffer (since this
	  is only used locally)

2005-08-26 00:37  cclepper

	* added regular and IIDC controls for video adjustment.  tinkering
	  with vdig settings for capture rects.

2005-08-26 00:35  cclepper

	* more cleaning.  fixed possible memory leak

2005-08-26 00:34  cclepper

	* fixed memory leak

2005-08-25 18:55  zmoelnig

	* further performance improvements (without crashes)

2005-08-25 17:59  zmoelnig

	* another attempt to get the fps from ffmpeg (the different
	  versions of this library with the same version-number are driving
	  me...)

2005-08-25 11:18  zmoelnig

	* there seem to be different versions of ffmpeg-4.0.9 around: one
	  (from CVS!) which takes an extra flags-argument for
	  av_seek_frame() and one that does not.  so i did an extra ifdef,
	  whether the AV_SEEK_FLAGS are defined

2005-08-24 15:20  zmoelnig

	* implemented (similar to) georg's implementation (but made it less
	  crash prone) should be faster, but if the content of the
	  pix_buffer changes, this is not automatically reflected on
	  pix_buffer_read's outlet (you must retrigger the index)

2005-08-24 14:34  zmoelnig

	* added "open"-message to read images (no movies yet)

2005-08-24 13:47  zmoelnig

	* verbosity now also states something about where it comes from
	  ("DV4L: closed" instead of "closed")

2005-08-24 13:45  zmoelnig

	* removed ifdef's; they should be handled by inheritance

2005-08-24 13:34  zmoelnig

	* query the FPS and report it to the info-outlet (now we have:
	  "list <numframes> <xsize> <ysize> <fps>"; should we split it into
	  separate messages with prepends like "fps <fps>" ??)

2005-08-24 13:29  zmoelnig

	* added a getFPS()-message to query the frames-per-second (as
	  reported by the decoding unit)

2005-08-23 17:01  zmoelnig

	* compiler shutups

2005-08-23 14:28  zmoelnig

	* started to crash again and then stopped (??); anyhow did some
	  more initialization

2005-08-22 19:06  zmoelnig

	* added some comments on why which decoding-library is placed where
	  moved FFMPEG backwards (as it fails more often than not and is
	  not really stable)

2005-08-22 18:43  zmoelnig

	* even more bug-fixes

2005-08-22 16:05  zmoelnig

	* bug-fix: now it is possible to decode some movies (i don't think
	  the code worked at all before) more bug-fix: doesn't crash so
	  easily anymore even more bug-fix: allow seeking of frames when
	  possible (but this is rather seldom)

2005-08-22 16:03  zmoelnig

	* use initialization outside of constructor

2005-08-19 21:17  zmoelnig

	* these have moved to src/Manips in HEAD

2005-08-19 19:26  zmoelnig

	* fixed small type

2005-08-19 17:52  zmoelnig

	* added [{fragment,vertex}_program] from the vertex_array-branch.
	  (if DONT_USE_ARB is set, neither fragment- nor vertex-programs
	  should be build) a bit of re-ordering of the include-files taken
	  from the vertex_array-branch: just in case we ever need to
	  include GL/gl.h in GemState.h, this would break all the weird
	  glext-stuff, because GL/gl.h would be included _before_ we do our
	  magic; now it should work

2005-08-19 17:49  zmoelnig

	* added [{fragmen,vertex}_program] from the vertex_array-branch.

2005-08-19 16:18  zmoelnig

	* added files from MAIN (20050819)

2005-08-19 16:12  zmoelnig

	* merged with MAIN (20050819)

2005-08-19 14:52  zmoelnig

	* updated to MAIN (20050819)

2005-08-19 14:46  zmoelnig

	* updated to MAIN (20050819)

2005-08-19 14:32  zmoelnig

	* updated to MAIN (20050819)

2005-08-19 14:28  zmoelnig

	* updated to MAIN (20050819)

2005-08-17 16:51  cclepper

	* changed some of the file loading code.  should be faster to load
	  a movie now.

2005-08-17 16:49  cclepper

	* removed some debug lines

2005-08-17 10:12  zmoelnig

	* call the Makefile in src/ rather than src/Gnu

2005-08-16 06:39  tigital

	* [OSX] added menubar message to [gemwin]:  1 = show  0 = hide
	  everything (full "kiosk" mode) -1 = hide menubar, but autoShow
	  with mouse at screen top - this is only effective when gemwindow
	  has "focus"

2005-08-01 21:13  cclepper

	* device selection works.  started VDIG functions

2005-08-01 21:12  cclepper

	* new frame count outlet

2005-07-22 00:34  cclepper

	* added the basics for message based compression settings.  Fixed
	  quite a few things

2005-07-21 19:59  zmoelnig

	* file Makefile was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-21 19:59  zmoelnig

	* fixed the "clean" target

2005-07-20 00:55  cclepper

	* added ifdef for _APPLE__

2005-07-20 00:35  cclepper

	* initial commit

2005-07-16 19:36  zmoelnig

	* do checking for ARB even if specified explicitely (this also
	  turns on the check if you don't specify whether you want ARB	or
	  not)

2005-07-16 19:36  zmoelnig

	* file configure was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-16 19:36  zmoelnig

	* file configure.ac was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-15 15:29  zmoelnig

	* (changed 2 files, committed 4...) a mechanism for finding files
	  from optional libraries (those that can be turned off with
	  "--without-BLA") "--with-BLA-includes=/bi/ba/bo" will add
	  "-I/bi/ba/bo" to the CXXFLAGS "--with-BLA-libs=/foo/bar" will add
	  "-L/foo/bar" to the LIBS if the support for this library is
	  turned OFF (--without-BLA), then these flags will do nothing.
	  the arguments need be paths (a check is performed whether the
	  given directory exists) however, they can also be relative paths!

2005-07-15 15:29  zmoelnig

	* file acinclude.m4 was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-15 15:29  zmoelnig

	* file aclocal.m4 was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-15 12:11  zmoelnig

	* checking for X-infrastructure on OS-X only if explicitely desired
	  by the user (with "--with-x"); by default it is turned off added
	  alias "--with-imagemagick" for "--with-ImageMagick" fixed BUG,
	  that prevented configure from checking for optional libraries: if
	  the checking for 1 library was turned off, all consectuive
	  libraries were automatically turned off too (i guess it was the
	  same with truning ON, but haven't tested)

2005-07-14 22:45  zmoelnig

	* more quoting in configure.ac checked in configure, so people
	  don't have to go through the hazzle of autoconf

2005-07-14 22:38  zmoelnig

	* made the strip-test less verbose

2005-07-07 15:03  zmoelnig

	* use std::max() instead of max() as suggested by T.Schulze to make
	  it compile on windows with gcc; hope this doesn't break
	  M$VC-compilation btw: pix_filmNT should NOT be used; use
	  pix_filmNEW instead

2005-07-07 13:37  zmoelnig

	* added "--with-pd" flag for the bundle-loader; if neither this
	  flag is given nor PD_BINARY is set, $(which pd) is used (so the
	  path pd should be in $PATH)

2005-07-07 13:30  zmoelnig

	* fixed GEM_CHECK_LDFLAGS: better detection whether sucess or not
	  fixed GEM_CHECK_FRAMEWORK: "-framwork" is a linker flag instead
	  of a compiler flag. adapted changes to GEM_CHECK_LDFLAGS

	  also included acinclude.m4, since this is really just a copy of
	  aclocal.m4 (with my automake) and adding this files removes a
	  dependency on automake

2005-07-07 13:25  zmoelnig

	* delete depen-files

2005-07-07 13:25  zmoelnig

	* file Makefile.subdir was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-07 13:24  zmoelnig

	* use "-C"-flag to make instead of "cd" when (dist)cleaning
	  subdirectories

2005-07-07 13:22  zmoelnig

	* file GemMath.h was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-07 13:22  zmoelnig

	* moved stuff from GemLibs/darwinStuff/ into GemMath.h reflect this
	  in the files that included the old files

2005-07-07 09:34  zmoelnig

	* moved variable declarations to the beginning of the
	  open()-function, so they are not crossed by goto-jumps

2005-07-07 09:28  zmoelnig

	* removed call to class_set_extern_dir() in __APPLE__

2005-07-04 20:05  zmoelnig

	* copied from Gnu/README.build and added more information

2005-07-04 20:05  zmoelnig

	* file README.linux was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-04 14:11  zmoelnig

	* set glNormal3f() before rendering, so [text3d] becomes robust
	  against changing the normal from outside (e.g. like
	  [textextruded]) is this is a bug in ftgl ?

2005-07-04 14:10  zmoelnig

	* changed __apple__ to __APPLE__

2005-07-04 13:54  zmoelnig

	* more beautiful (?) output on failure...

2005-07-04 13:17  zmoelnig

	* use HAVE_VIDEO4LINUX rather than __linux__

2005-07-04 13:16  zmoelnig

	* use HAVE_VIDEO4LINUX rather than __linux__ commented out some
	  verbosity

2005-07-04 13:05  zmoelnig

	* turn of debug mode

2005-07-04 11:22  zmoelnig

	* you can now specify a preferred library for decoding a file.	if
	  one is specified, it is tried as the first lib. if it fails, all
	  libs are tried in the default order (read: the specified lib is
	  tried twice: once as the preferred lib, and once as part of all
	  libs)

2005-07-04 11:20  zmoelnig

	* print "<codec> failed" when not being able to open instead of
	  "<codec> unsupported"

2005-07-04 11:18  zmoelnig

	* fixed codec initialization

2005-07-04 10:43  zmoelnig

	* renamed GEM_WITH_TARGET to GEM_TARGET (and use AC_ARG_ENABLE
	  instead of AC_ARG_WITH)

2005-07-04 10:42  zmoelnig

	* Gem.${EXT} depends on subdirs

2005-07-04 10:40  zmoelnig

	* added flag for videofilm-new removed "Base" from the selectable
	  modules

2005-07-04 10:36  zmoelnig

	* added a function for swapping Red and Blue that works in-place

2005-07-04 10:35  zmoelnig

	* added comments added NEW_VIDEOFILM

2005-07-03 21:03  zmoelnig

	* added check for "dos2unix"

2005-07-03 21:03  zmoelnig

	* file Make.config.in was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-03 20:53  zmoelnig

	* use "-MM" for "make depend" with gnu-preprocessors

2005-07-03 20:42  zmoelnig

	* file Make.include was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-07-03 20:42  zmoelnig

	* updated build-system after having a look at the Gnu-make
	  documentation what's better:	       SOURCES are generated on the
	  fly	     .cpp-files containing whitespaces are ignored (rather
	  than crashing the build.process)  dependencies are calculated on
	  a per-file basis (rather than via Make.depend)   better
	  subdirectory handling (not for "clean"ing though)	   better
	  check for "strip" (partly taken from wine)

2005-06-29 17:44  zmoelnig

	* use size_t for datasize

2005-06-29 16:45  zmoelnig

	* use "size_t" for dataSize instead of "int" or "long" or "unsigned
	  char" ...

2005-06-27 18:11  zmoelnig

	* fixed typo

2005-06-26 20:03  zmoelnig

	* prettier results better handling of "strip"

2005-06-26 19:38  zmoelnig

	* use configure to set the extension -"- to set reference-path -"-
	  to set STRIP (on real check though)

2005-06-26 17:33  zmoelnig

	* added checks for LDFLAGS

2005-06-26 17:11  zmoelnig

	* HAVE_LIBAV{format,codec} is now convered by HAVE_FFMPEG
	  additionally we now have a HAVE_VIDEO4LINUX

2005-06-26 17:07  zmoelnig

	* framework-checks and cxxflags-checks

2005-06-26 14:46  zmoelnig

	* "configure"-target

2005-06-26 14:39  zmoelnig

	* file install-sh was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-06-26 14:39  zmoelnig

	* works better (still not yet where we want to be)

2005-06-25 18:49  zmoelnig

	* file config.guess was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-06-25 18:49  zmoelnig

	* file config.sub was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-06-25 18:49  zmoelnig

	* first try of a new build-system based on gnters code,
	  autoconf>2.57 and that gets rid of the Gnu-directory

2005-06-20 16:47  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2005-06-20 16:47  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation (thanks to georg holzmann)

2005-06-20 16:41  zmoelnig

	* fixed documentation

2005-06-20 16:41  zmoelnig

	* added newline to end of file

2005-06-20 16:41  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglMultiTexCoord2fARB.h was added on branch vertex_array
	  on 2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-06-19 20:45  zmoelnig

	* replaced WIN32 (or NT) (or _WINDOWS) (or...) by __WIN32__

2005-06-19 20:41  zmoelnig

	* replaced WIN32 with __WIN32__

2005-06-19 20:38  zmoelnig

	* unix2dos (m$vc does _not_ like unix-linebreaks in the dsp-file)
	  added newer files use __WIN32__ instead of other windows-defines

2005-06-19 20:36  zmoelnig

	* added DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT (i think this is the default on most
	  windows-compile-machines, and currently it fails to work on my
	  setting, when i have time to fix it, i will re-enable glext on
	  w32)

2005-06-19 20:34  zmoelnig

	* renamed defines "NT", "WIN32" and "_WINDOWS" by "__WIN32__"

2005-06-19 20:32  zmoelnig

	* file GEMgluPerspective.cpp was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-06-19 20:32  zmoelnig

	* file GEMgluPerspective.h was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-06-19 20:32  zmoelnig

	* suddenly m$vc didn't like variables "near" and "far", so i
	  renamed them to "m_near" and "m_far"

2005-06-19 19:11  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed (re)definition of WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN

2005-06-19 19:10  zmoelnig

	* fixed recursion-bug with distance()

2005-06-19 18:58  zmoelnig

	* added re-definition of GLU_SILHOUETTE _after_ including the
	  openGL-headers

2005-06-14 08:57  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug discovered (and fixed) by matju, where image-files
	  that opened but turned out to be a non-sgi-image, where not
	  closed again.

2005-06-09 18:09  ggeiger

	* Replaced "Programme" with PROGRAMFILES environment variable for
	  finding m_pd.h

2005-06-09 17:35  ggeiger

	* use ProgramFiles variable to detect path to pd

2005-06-03 11:29  zmoelnig

	* on linux, we are using pix_videoNEW instead of pix_videoLinux for
	  ages, it's time to remove it.  hopefully we can do this for other
	  platforms sometime as well

2005-06-03 11:20  zmoelnig

	* GemDAG has been obsoleted for years, it's time to remove it.
	  (probably something similar will reappear once we have threaded
	  rendering to multiple windows)

2005-06-03 11:10  zmoelnig

	* removed: people should (well, now they "must") run autoconf in
	  order to generate their own configure-script

2005-06-03 11:09  zmoelnig

	* added a note that tells people to run "autoconf" before
	  "./configure"

2005-06-03 10:57  zmoelnig

	* colors can now be RGB or (new:) RGBA

2005-06-03 08:55  zmoelnig

	* commented out XCloseDisplay() which keeps Gem from freezing but
	  is only a direty workaround (memory-leak + X-server hates too
	  many open displays) added a big warning to not forget it....

2005-06-03 08:54  zmoelnig

	* HELPSYMBOL_BASE must be defined _before_ including CPPExtern.h to
	  have any effect

2005-06-02 13:25  zmoelnig

	* added YUV-support normalized output to 0..1 (instead of 0..255)
	  always output RGBA-values (even for grayscale and YUV; alpha
	  defaults to 1.0)

2005-06-01 18:42  tigital

	* [OSX] OpenGL headers are now centrally located in Base/GemMan.h

2005-06-01 18:40  tigital

	* corrected description

2005-06-01 18:35  tigital

	* [OSX] OpenGL headers are in Base/GemMan.h

2005-06-01 18:34  tigital

	* [OSX] correct call to dialogCallback, not dialogMess (shuts up
	  gcc4.0 warning); small header change

2005-06-01 18:28  tigital

	* [NEW] added scale variable for scale of halftone [OSX]
	  compile-time check (via AvailabilityMacros.h) for support of
	  sinf() & friends in math.h (now defined in >10.4.x)

2005-06-01 17:57  tigital

	* [OSX] converted the last of the MACOSX to __APPLE__ ifdef's?

2005-06-01 17:48  tigital

	* coalesced #ifdef between linux & apple (since they are the same
	  typedefs)

2005-06-01 17:46  tigital

	* [OSX] corrected #ifdef and added LPVOID define

2005-06-01 17:43  tigital

	* [OSX] compile-time check (via AvailabilityMacros.h) for support
	  of sinf() & friends in math.h (now defined in >10.4.x)

2005-06-01 17:40  tigital

	* header includes now centralized in Base/GemMan.h

2005-06-01 17:38  tigital

	* [OSX] converted the last of the MACOSX to __APPLE__ ifdef's?

2005-06-01 17:36  tigital

	* more readable formatting

2005-06-01 17:32  tigital

	* [OSX] compile-time check (via AvailabilityMacros.h) for support
	  of sinf() & friends in math.h (now defined in >10.4.x)

2005-06-01 17:26  tigital

	* corrected spelling of SetVertex()

2005-06-01 17:20  tigital

	* now includes all OpenGL/ headers for OSX

2005-06-01 17:16  tigital

	* switched from vec_unpack2sh() (which apparently never existed,
	  yet worked prior to 10.4.x!) to vec_mergeh(); new #ifdef
	  __TIMING__ for timing frame process of altivec vs. scalar color
	  conversions

2005-06-01 17:08  tigital

	* added "#ifdef unix" so osx doesn't try compiling it (at least
	  until the future?)

2005-06-01 17:06  tigital

	* gcc4.0 fixes and miscellaneous cleanups:  AGL's swapinterval now
	  set in BuildGLContext()

2005-06-01 16:59  tigital

	* needed for proper Darwin configure-ing

2005-06-01 16:56  tigital

	* added Darwin configure stuff

2005-06-01 16:54  tigital

	* replaced ".pd_linux" with $(TARGET) so that we can use this on
	  more than one platform

2005-05-30 21:54  zmoelnig

	* use "ffmpeg-config --plugin-libs" instead of "ffmpeg-config
	  --libs" this allows us to link on x86_64 without problems

2005-05-25 20:44  zmoelnig

	* looked at the ugly #define-hacks and got some things right note:
	  these classes should vanish altogether on all platforms and be
	  replaced by the NEW-thingie.

2005-05-23 17:03  zmoelnig

	* made libjpeg and libtiff OPTIONAL libraries (which are used by
	  default if available) so platforms that dont have these libs
	  (like OSX) don't fail to configure any more

2005-05-23 17:01  zmoelnig

	* added HAVE_LIBJPEG and HAVE_LIBTIFF in order to compile with
	  image reading/writing support

2005-05-23 16:58  zmoelnig

	* made JPEG and TIFF reading/writing a compile-option this removes
	  the _hard_ dependency on libjpeg and libtiff, which should make
	  the configure easier on platforms that don't need libjpeg/libtiff

2005-05-23 14:11  zmoelnig

	* enforcing of the presence of libtiff, libjpeg and libpng is only
	  need on linux (btw, it shouldn't be enforced here too!)

2005-05-23 13:59  zmoelnig

	* better detection for FFMPEG (now we also have autodetection; i
	  hope ffmpeg has stabilized the API enough, so this won't break
	  for some months)

2005-05-23 13:56  zmoelnig

	* added preprocessor-flags CPPFLAGS to the compiler-flags

2005-05-23 11:29  zmoelnig

	* enforce X only on Linux (Darwin can do without)

2005-05-23 11:02  zmoelnig

	* on "distclean" remove ALL .o (and .obj) files, even those that
	  are not in Make.source

2005-05-21 04:34  tigital

	* corrected spelling

2005-05-19 13:41  zmoelnig

	* did better quoting, this should fix the issues with autoconf>2.53

2005-05-17 16:00  zmoelnig

	* changed uname-flags "--machine" and "--kernel-name" to "-m" and
	  "-s" (which should work on osX too

2005-05-17 02:24  tigital

	* updates for config system that identify darwin 10.4

2005-05-13 21:48  zmoelnig

	* [pix_crop] now straights images that are upside down (this is: if
	  you have the same pix-material as both "normal" and "upsidedown",
	  the same parameters to [pix_crop] will now produce the same
	  results this change has the same performance as the old one, it
	  just makes life easier

2005-05-10 18:51  zmoelnig

	* added [spot_light] by Pierre-Oliver Charlebois; did some changes
	  to make it use the world_light parent-class instead of
	  reinventing the wheel. hope this doesn't break anything with the
	  original version

2005-05-04 20:31  zmoelnig

	* fixed the "external" pix_buffer_class

2005-05-04 15:22  zmoelnig

	* added a flag to declare the pdclass-definition non-static (so we
	  can findbyclass() from other objects)

2005-05-04 15:21  zmoelnig

	* finally made [pix_buffer_read] and [pix_buffer_write] to be in
	  their own source-files added automatic playback and cyclic
	  reading of [pix_buffer_read] (based on an idea of Florian Grond &
	  Lasse Scherffig)

2005-05-03 19:32  zmoelnig

	* entry for DONT_USE_ARB

2005-05-03 19:31  zmoelnig

	* added runtime-checking for glBindProgramARB the results are
	  displayed in Base/configLinux.h rather than via command-line args
	  to the compiler

2005-05-03 17:47  zmoelnig

	* added some verbose output at the end of configuration, so the
	  user will know what is going on

2005-05-03 13:35  zmoelnig

	* on windows (and maybe osX too?) the host-side interface looks a
	  bit different than on linux a couple of #define's should fix
	  that.

	  fixed an error on windows+osX that came from stupid copy'n'paste
	  from the pd-sources for dynamic loading

	  the FreeFrame-specs said something about a "maximum" of 8
	  parameters, which is exceeded by some plugins as i just noticed;
	  removed the clamping of numparams to 8 (don't know why it was
	  there in the first place)

	  i hope this includes the changes needed to make it compile on osX
	  haven't tested these changes on windows yet, but after my
	  experiences i made yesterday when i booted into windows, it
	  _should_ work

2005-04-27 11:26  zmoelnig

	* changed behaviour for rectangle textures to be conformant to the
	  behaviour with non-rectangle textures:: "1,1" always denotes the
	  upper-right corner of the pixel-buffer, so the user need not care
	  what kind of texture they are using

2005-04-27 11:24  zmoelnig

	* set "state->texture" to "2", when using rectangle textures don't
	  overwrite "m_repeat" with "GL_CLAMP" when doing
	  rectangle-textures, as they will ignore that flag anyhow

2005-04-27 11:21  zmoelnig

	* more advanced usage of the "texture": 2==rectangle (so we can
	  react on the specifics of rectangle-textures in downstream
	  objects)

2005-04-26 05:34  tigital

	* corrected yv12 to rgb on osx, yv12 to rgba/bgra, and error
	  reporting for copy2ImageStruct

2005-04-26 03:58  tigital

	* changed boolean to bool, which is osx-compilable and more in line
	  with the rest of gem's codebase

2005-04-25 19:01  zmoelnig

	* help-patch for [pix_movement2]

2005-04-25 19:00  zmoelnig

	* another object that tries to get the movement within an
	  image-stream

2005-04-24 23:59  cclepper

	* added check for state->texture and that actual coordinates exist
	  in the render method

2005-04-21 16:58  zmoelnig

	* initial support for loading plugins un windows and osX (still not
	  tested)

2005-04-21 14:05  zmoelnig

	* fixed...

2005-04-21 13:46  zmoelnig

	* added an enable-flag for --freg-struct-return (for
	  FreeFrame-plugins) since i am not sure what this will break it is
	  disabled by default; if you want to use the FreeFrame-plugins,
	  the option is either to compile Gem with  this flag or to
	  recompile the plugins without...

2005-04-21 11:42  zmoelnig

	* fixed bug that crashed pd/Gem when an exception was thrown (wrong
	  type...) fixed bug with a parameter-offset of 1

2005-04-20 19:31  zmoelnig

	* initial support for FreeFrame-plugins currently i have only
	  tested this on linux

2005-04-18 19:06  zmoelnig

	* usage of the "--disable-ARB" to disable ARB-vertex-shaders

2005-04-18 19:02  zmoelnig

	* adding a "--disable-ARB" flag for disabling the build of
	  ARB-vertex-programs

2005-04-18 17:59  zmoelnig

	* added feed-back when checking for avifile (before, there was
	  nothing indicating that libavifile will be used if (and only if)
	  it was found)

2005-04-18 17:52  zmoelnig

	* added support for ImageMagick++ (used here for loading and saving
	  images)

2005-04-18 17:51  zmoelnig

	* added support for ImageMagick (currently used for loading/writing
	  images)

2005-04-18 16:08  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug that crashed Gem when using this object with
	  [pix_imageInPlace]: the texcoord-array was accessed without
	  checking the size of it first!!

2005-04-18 15:17  zmoelnig

	* regrouped things even more (put type-checks before
	  library-checks)

2005-04-18 14:52  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up autoconf a bit  + prelaminary support for icc  +
	  grouped header/library search together  + FIRST search whether
	  headers are present, THEN look for matching libraries  +
	  hopefully fixed bug, where compile stopped when no
	  font-rendering-libs where installed

2005-04-13 19:33  zmoelnig

	* a function that claims to return an integer should return an
	  integer

2005-04-11 18:14  tigital

	* [stupid]correct name in header

2005-04-11 18:14  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglBindProgramARB.cpp was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-04-07 14:52  zmoelnig

	* an example for using display-lists

2005-04-07 13:06  zmoelnig

	* help for [scopeXYZ~]

2005-04-06 21:02  zmoelnig

	* made [scopeXYZ~] work (although there is still one single point
	  left that sometimes occurs at 0/0/0)

2005-04-05 12:52  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglGetFloatv.cpp was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-04-05 12:52  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglGetFloatv.h was added on branch vertex_array on

	* file GEMglNewList.h was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-04-05 12:52  zmoelnig

	* added wrapper for glEndList() and glNewList(): this is cool as it
	  allows to makeuser defined display-lists (performance boost)

2005-04-05 12:52  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglEndList.cpp was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-04-05 12:52  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglEndList.h was added on branch vertex_array on
	  2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-04-04 18:50  zmoelnig

	* a help-patch

2005-04-04 18:27  zmoelnig

	* adapted to the longer feature-vectors of [pix_multiblob]; a first
	  help-patch

2005-04-04 18:24  zmoelnig

	* output more information (like minX/Y, weighted position,...)
	  weighted position produces more stable tracking

2005-04-01 09:45  zmoelnig

	* #ifdef'ed the altivec code properly, so it will compile on other
	  systems as well

2005-04-01 03:26  tigital

	* initial altivec speedups to: bgra to yuv; yv12 to yuv

2005-03-31 18:25  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation a bit

2005-03-31 18:07  zmoelnig

	* missed a "break" in a case-loop.

2005-03-31 17:58  zmoelnig

	* use "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" instead of "-1" as the default drawType
	  (negative values are a bad idea for GLenum)

	  (and fix the parsing of the drawstyle a big)

2005-03-31 17:55  zmoelnig

	* use "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" instead of "-1" as the default drawType
	  (negative values are a bad idea for GLenum)

2005-03-31 17:47  zmoelnig

	* a blobtracker based on [pix_multiblob] and some objects from
	  "iemmatrix"

2005-03-31 17:00  zmoelnig

	* use "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" instead of "-1" as the default drawType
	  (negative values are a bad idea for GLenum)

2005-03-31 16:58  zmoelnig

	* added a new drawType "GL_DEFAULT_GEM" (since using "-1" was a bad
	  idea for GLenum)

2005-03-31 16:40  zmoelnig

	* changed LIBS="-Wl,-shared -Wl,-export-dynamic $LIBS" to
	  LIBS="-shared -Wl,-export-dynamic $LIBS" this should fix the
	  problem with FC3

2005-03-31 08:42  zmoelnig

	* there are even better conversions (at least you can control all
	  YUV<->RGB conversion on a central point)

2005-03-30 22:02  zmoelnig

	* a detector for multiple blobs (no tracking! as this should be
	  done externally); the output-data is in zexy/iemmatrix's "matrix"
	  format; i am not sure whether this is really good (as it makes
	  libraries interdependent and of course i favour my own libs) but
	  it is much more elegant than anything else i could think of

2005-03-30 21:48  zmoelnig

	* new Geos: [scopeXYZ~] and [torus]

2005-03-30 20:58  zmoelnig

	* added "default"-drawtype

2005-03-22 21:41  zmoelnig

	* changed RGB<->YUV conversion to be more standards-compliant;
	  clamped the results

2005-03-22 03:48  tigital

	* more OpenGL wrappers I've had sitting on my drive

2005-03-22 03:48  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglActiveTextureARB.cpp was added on branch vertex_array
	  on 2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-03-22 03:48  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglActiveTextureARB.h was added on branch vertex_array on

	  on 2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-03-09 01:24  tigital

	* IOhannes: the gl headers and such are in GemMan.h:  why would you
	  want to put them in GemMan.cpp?  I'm a big fan of including
	  headers in, um, the header :-)  Btw, the "GL/ vs. OpenGL/" thing
	  is due to apple's use of framework's...

2005-03-07 16:33  zmoelnig

	* use DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT rather than the INCLUDE_GLEXT (which is
	  nowhere defined)

2005-03-07 16:31  zmoelnig

	* properly include GL/glext.h (btw, wtfh are apple's openGL-headers
	  in openGL/ instead of GL/ ... nevermind)

2005-03-07 10:19  zmoelnig

	* include <new> to enable the use of real C++ constructors

2005-03-06 12:21  zmoelnig

	* removed [change] (is in pd for some times)

2005-02-28 02:15  tigital

	* - added support for YV12(short*) for pdp2gem - added support for
	  RGB/BGR to setCsizeByFormat - began altivec support
	  (non-functional atm)

2005-02-28 01:05  tigital

	* - added support for YV12(short*) for pdp2gem - added support for
	  RGB/BGR to setCsizeByFormat - began altivec support

2005-02-07 19:18  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up, and removed crashes

2005-02-07 16:56  zmoelnig

	* fixed bug that crashed pd when NULL was returned by glGetString()

2005-02-07 16:31  zmoelnig

	* cleaned up a bit

2005-02-07 16:07  zmoelnig

	* using own "dv1394.h", since libdv4-dev has skipped this file

2005-02-07 16:05  zmoelnig

	* windoze does not like array-sizes that are determined at runtime

2005-02-07 14:59  zmoelnig

	* catching errors that might get thrown by glx

2005-02-07 14:42  zmoelnig

2005-02-07 14:21  zmoelnig

	* use Base/GemVector instead of own CVector3

2005-02-07 14:20  zmoelnig

	* file GemVector.h was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-02-07 14:20  zmoelnig

	* a class for 3D-vectors (formerly found in Manips/camera)

2005-02-07 14:20  zmoelnig

	* file GemVector.cpp was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2005-02-07 13:46  zmoelnig

	* oh, it's here again...

2005-02-07 13:45  zmoelnig

	* [pix_dv] is covered by [pix_video]

2005-02-07 13:43  zmoelnig

	* updated a bit

2005-02-07 13:04  zmoelnig

	* hopefully really fixed the including of GL/glext.h: use
	  DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT instead of INCLUDE_GLEXT additionally use
	  GL_GLEXT_LEGACY, as this auto-includes glext.h on some sytems
	  (mesa)

2005-02-07 13:02  zmoelnig

	* use FILM__NEW instead of __FILM__NEW use DONT_INCLUDE_GLEXT
	  instead of INCLUDE_GLEXT

2005-02-07 13:00  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglLoadTransposeMatrixf.cpp was added on branch
	  vertex_array on 2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-02-07 13:00  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglMultTransposeMatrixd.cpp was added on branch

2005-02-07 13:00  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglMultTransposeMatrixf.cpp was added on branch

	  vertex_array on 2005-08-19 12:29:56 +0000

2005-02-07 13:00  zmoelnig

	* fixed defines: gl*TransposeMatrix() are available onle on
	  openGL>=1.3 (not >=1.1 as it was) gl*ARB() were used only, if
	  GL_ARB_vertex_program was un(!)defined...

2005-01-31 21:26  tigital

	* now functional on osx

2005-01-31 18:50  tigital

	* updated to my setup

2005-01-14 09:54  zmoelnig

	* added the missing " to the NEW_VIDEOFILM definition

2005-01-14 09:53  zmoelnig

	* ./configure does not call "makesource" but includes it; thus the
	  "$@" is not as expected an (empty) list of directories for which
	  we should generate Make.source but rather "dummy sh"; now we
	  check, whether the running script ($0) is "*configure", and if
	  so, we assume that the "passed" list is 0.

2005-01-12 20:20  zmoelnig

	* oops again; forgot a "

2005-01-12 19:12  zmoelnig

	* oops; should run again (note: this is just rev1.27 with __NEW__
	  replaced by NEW_VIDEOFILM)

2005-01-11 12:44  zmoelnig

	* who the f**k used "__NEW__" to enable/disable different
	  film/movie-objects ??? preprocessor-defines starting with "__"
	  are system only!! i have renamed __NEW__ to NEW_VIDEOFILM __FILM
	  __NEW to FILM_NEW and __VIDEO__NEW to VIDEO_NEW

2005-01-11 11:22  zmoelnig

	* added Exceptions: whenever we don't want an object to be created
	  because of boundary-conditions (e.g. wrong arguments) we can now
	  throw a GemException("errorstring") which is caught by the
	  setup-routine and prevents the object from being created;

	  fixed the m_objectname thing: now even the constructor of a
	  GemObject will now the name that was used to create it (as far as
	  we can tell)

2004-12-26 18:43  tigital

	* oops!  shouldn't include "Base/GemFuncUtil.h" after #ifdef
	  __cplusplus extern "C" {...}

2004-12-24 10:54  timblech

	* fixed bug

2004-12-22 19:03  tigital

	* - header consolidation:  #includes should go in headers (or in
	  this case, already are)!

2004-12-22 18:49  tigital

	* ppc only:  sqrt speed up via assembly instruction (at least 2x) -
	  header consolidation:  #includes should go in headers! -
	  correctly converts YUV to RGBA and back, if needed

2004-12-22 18:48  tigital

	* ppc only:  sqrt speed up via assembly instruction (at least 2x) -
	  header consolidation:  #includes should go in headers! - now

2004-12-22 18:44  tigital

2004-12-22 17:58  tigital

	* add functions for 5 arguments

2004-12-15 15:02  zmoelnig

	* fixed to compile under win/lin again

2004-12-15 07:21  tigital

	* cleanup dialogMess

2004-12-15 07:17  tigital

	* fixed crash bug when changing dimen or colorspace while
	  rendering:  some header cleanup, too

2004-12-14 01:49  tigital

	* minimal OSX-only changes for multiple_window branch, now it
	  compiles :-)

2004-12-14 01:40  tigital

	* OSX-only changes for multiple_window branch:	added
	  topmostGemWindow() (but don't know what it's really supposed to
	  do:  this is just a copy of the XWindows function), and added
	  window bounds output to mouse messages

2004-12-14 01:30  tigital

	* OSX-only changes:  now it compiles

2004-12-14 01:02  tigital

	* update to my setup

2004-12-14 00:41  tigital

	* typo correction in altivec function name

2004-12-14 00:25  tigital

	* type correction in altivec function name

2004-12-13 18:51  zmoelnig

	* added check whether there is a valid display before destroying
	  it...

2004-12-13 14:22  zmoelnig

	* fixed the patch; how comes it is broken at all ? a check ensured,
	  that even the example-patch from gem-0.70 has the same
	  weirdnesses - so the problem seems to be a change in the
	  pd-fileformat rather than the patch itself; this should work now
	  (although i am not sure, whether it really does what it is
	  supposed to do...) wow, what a long changelog....

2004-12-07 16:05  timblech

	* simplified outlet

2004-12-07 14:24  timblech

	* initial checkin pix_mean_color

2004-12-07 12:52  zmoelnig

	* output events through the outlet instead of dedicated objects
	  ([gemmouse])

2004-12-07 12:50  zmoelnig

	* changed the EventMask to get focus-events

2004-12-07 12:48  zmoelnig

	* added infoMess() to output information

2004-12-07 12:47  zmoelnig

	* added an outlet for events (and some comments)

	* oops, last checkin had VBO disabled...

2004-12-06 14:43  zmoelnig

	* vector-based rotation on a per-vertex basis; hard to handle
	  though...

2004-12-06 14:41  zmoelnig

	* objects to read/write data from/to tables; data is interleaved
	  (e.g. vertex-data is stored in the table as [x1 y1 z1 w1 x2 y2 z2
	  w2 ...]; probably there is a need for [vertex_tabread4] that uses
	  4 tables for non-interleaved data (x, y, z and w)

2004-12-06 14:39  zmoelnig

	* made all arrays have 4 components; this enables us to use the
	  color-array as vertex-array and so on; thus is make any sense ?

2004-12-06 10:38  zmoelnig

	* merged in the changes from HEAD that allows to give the
	  subdirectories for which we want Make.source to be created

2004-12-06 10:34  zmoelnig

	* use the provided dv1394.h instead of an external one

2004-12-06 10:29  zmoelnig

	* use the local dv1394.h file

2004-12-06 10:02  zmoelnig

	* now it's gone in this galaxis; where will it re-appear like
	  undead ?

2004-12-03 13:15  zmoelnig

	* added newline at end of file

2004-11-28 01:00  tigital

	* some wrappers for gl "program" stuff:  should be ok for any GL
	  with ARB_vertex_program and/or ARB_fragment_program defined

2004-11-28 01:00  zmoelnig

	  versions since 1.1?

2004-11-28 00:51  zmoelnig

	* file GEMglLoadMatrixd.cpp was added on branch vertex_array on

2004-11-28 00:47  tigital

	* pedantic changes to header & descriptions :-)

2004-11-28 00:46  tigital

	* added defines for multitexture, vertex/fragment programs, and
	  matrix stuff...plus pragma's to more easily find the numerical
	  seperations

2004-11-25 11:08  zmoelnig

	* when we receive a window-resize-event, we need not get the new
	  dimensions explicitly, as they are already given in the
	  arguments...

2004-11-24 16:53  zmoelnig

	* Cyrille's [gemlist_info] that gets the current
	  transformation-matrix (why have i not added this long before ???)

2004-11-24 16:46  zmoelnig

	* made the new size settable; LATER think about using a *faster*
	  algorithm...

2004-11-24 16:43  zmoelnig

	* fixed to match jamies spelling-correction in Base/GemShape

2004-11-24 16:37  zmoelnig

	* added templates for the gem2pdp-bridge

2004-11-05 15:33  tigital

	* added comments about auto message

2004-11-05 15:30  tigital

	* added blend message

2004-10-27 12:53  zmoelnig

	* hacked a bit to get the glext-prototypes loaded correctly with
	  nvidia's headers...

2004-10-27 12:43  zmoelnig

	* added a lot of defines to prevent from compiling on machines that
	  don't support it...

2004-10-26 02:58  tigital

	* spelling correction!

2004-10-26 02:52  tigital

	* updated to correct GemState for vbo's

2004-10-26 02:42  tigital

	* update to relative paths for files; added new files (vertex_ &
	  fragment_program & such) to compile

2004-10-26 02:40  tigital

	* __APPLE__ instead of MACOSX

2004-10-26 02:37  tigital

	* update to VBO version

2004-10-26 02:35  tigital

	* fixed bad header, added some debug info beyond just the
	  "MAX_PROGRAM_*" returns

2004-10-22 15:44  tigital

	* [no log message]

2004-10-22 15:39  tigital

2004-10-20 16:10  tigital

	* // powerOfTwo() optimization from "Hacker's Delight":  much
	  faster!

2004-10-12 20:34  zmoelnig

	* use the provided dv1394.h instead of an external one

2004-10-12 20:34  zmoelnig

	* added dv1394.h from "dvgrab"-sources

2004-10-12 13:49  zmoelnig

	* use the dv1394.h from the kernel and not the deprecated-one from
	  libdv-dev

2004-10-11 11:11  zmoelnig

	* [gemkeyname] under linux now behaves more like pd's [keyname]
	  (e.g. uniform keynames); thanks to gerard van dongen

2004-10-08 16:47  zmoelnig

	* we don't want this anymore: all objects are autoregistering

2004-10-08 16:44  zmoelnig

	* don't want this anymore: objects are auto-registering themselves!

2004-10-08 16:29  zmoelnig

	* don't want this anymore: objects are auto-registering themselves!

2004-10-08 16:26  zmoelnig

	* don't want this anymore: objects are auto-registering themselves!

2004-10-08 16:08  zmoelnig

	* as cyrille requested: doing one more point... (hope this doesn't
	  break anything, but i guess cyrille is the only one who really
	  cares about such features)

2004-10-08 15:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed argument handling: 1 argument: gridX=gridY 2 arguments:
	  gridX, gridY 3 arguments: gridX, gridY, height

2004-09-15 17:41  zmoelnig

	* new and updated help-patches (thanks cyrille)

2004-09-15 17:18  zmoelnig

	* initial addition (thanks cyrille)

2004-09-15 17:06  zmoelnig

	* initial addition (thanks cyrille)

2004-09-15 16:50  zmoelnig

	* merged the newWave_texture in; incorporated cyrilles changes:
	  added dither-noise against denormalization phenomenons: wouldn't
	  it be better clamp denormals to 0 like with PD_BADLFOAT ??

2004-09-15 15:15  zmoelnig

	* cyrilles changes: made the number of faces settable via a
	  message#9

2004-09-06 14:13  zmoelnig

	* subtract to vertex-arrays

2004-09-06 14:12  zmoelnig

	* resize a vertex-array: the resampling is rather poor (no
	  interpolation)

2004-09-06 14:12  zmoelnig

	* multiply a vertex-array by a constant matrix

2004-08-30 16:47  zmoelnig

	* rebuild the VBO if the arrays are dirty (is this necessary on osX
	  ?) removed a lot of variables lingering around and doing nothing;
	  inherit from GemVertex instead of GemBase

2004-08-30 16:44  zmoelnig

	* use of setModified(); inherit from GemVertex instead of GemBase

2004-08-30 16:44  zmoelnig

	* use of setModified(); allow 0x0-grids

2004-08-30 16:42  zmoelnig

	* inherit from GemVertex instead of GemBase;

2004-08-30 16:40  zmoelnig

	* inherit from GemVertex instead of GemBase; use of setModified()

2004-08-30 16:40  zmoelnig

	* inherit from GemVertex instead of GemBase

2004-08-30 16:39  zmoelnig

	* use of setModified()

2004-08-30 16:39  zmoelnig

	* inherit from GemVertex instead of GemBase; use of setModified();
	  renamed the "mode"-message to "type" (now it is the same as for
	  DualVertex-manipulators)

2004-08-30 16:36  zmoelnig

	* moved to src/Vertex

2004-08-30 16:34  zmoelnig

	* handle the "dirtyVertex" of GemState and GemCache

2004-08-30 16:33  zmoelnig

	* GemVertex is now the parent-class of all the vertex-stuff; the
	  main thing that is done here is re-defining setModified() to tell
	  the cache, that the vertex-arrays have changed

2004-08-30 15:22  zmoelnig

	* added VertexDirty to indicate whether one of the vertex-arrays
	  has changed LATER: think about a flag for each vertex-array to
	  avoid uploading of unchanged arrays

2004-08-27 17:31  tigital

	* forgot a coupla GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW_ARB's

2004-08-27 16:34  tigital

	* cached VBO buffers better

2004-08-27 08:51  zmoelnig

	* this is now in src/Vertex/

2004-08-27 08:49  zmoelnig

	* moved jamies changes from src/Geos to src/Vertex; made it compile
	  on linux (and i guess on windows too) disabled VBO for non-macs
	  as it slows down the system by numbers...

2004-08-27 08:47  zmoelnig

	* moved from src/Geos to src/Vertex; include <GL/gl.h> instead of
	  <OpenGL/gl.h> on non-apples

2004-08-27 05:54  tigital

	* VBO support

2004-08-27 05:50  tigital

	* VBO support

2004-08-26 14:21  zmoelnig

	* moved all the vertex_-objects from src/Geos to src/Vertex; added
	  vertex_mul, vertex_add vertex_offset,... now work on all arrays

2004-08-17 18:44  zmoelnig

	* initial [vertex_scale]: supports scaling of texcoords, normals,
	  vertices, color

2004-08-17 17:27  zmoelnig

	* merged with HEAD

2004-08-17 17:13  zmoelnig

	* merged with HEAD

2004-08-17 16:45  zmoelnig

	* src/yuv is deprecated

2004-08-17 16:11  zmoelnig

	* this shouldn't have been in the SIMD branch

2004-08-17 15:27  zmoelnig

	* a wrapper around [gemcontrol] and [gemwindow] to provide
	  compatibility with older patches

2004-08-17 15:04  zmoelnig

	* updated version

2004-08-17 14:59  zmoelnig

	* [gemwin] is replaced by [gemcontrol]+[gemwindow]

2004-08-17 14:55  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug when no directory-list is given at command-line
	  (merged from HEAD)

2004-08-17 14:53  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug when no directory-list is given at command-line

2004-08-17 14:45  zmoelnig

	* include GemSIMD (yes i know, that this is branch multiple_window,
	  but i have somehow cranked up the Pixes/ when branching : Pixes/
	  were branched to "multiple_window" when already in "SIMD"; so
	  this allows at least to compile again

2004-08-17 14:27  zmoelnig

	* made all the non-static message-handlers "virtual" so they can be
	  overridden (e.g. if we don't want them)

2004-08-17 14:10  zmoelnig

	* try to share display_lists (however, this needs a LOT of
	  re-thinking)

2004-08-17 14:04  zmoelnig

	* hopefully this is now in BRANCH instead of TAGged

2004-08-17 14:01  zmoelnig

	* this has vanished entirely (i just don't know how to check files
	  into a branch)

2004-08-17 13:40  zmoelnig

	* removed because the idea behind this file was really nonsense
	  (cannot share pointers across applications)

2004-08-14 21:59  zmoelnig

	* made it compile under windows (though not really functional
	  yet...)

2004-08-14 15:36  zmoelnig

	* merged in the vertex_array -branch (why: because i have f**ed up
	  the multiple_window-branch by mixing with vertices and there is
	  not much harm in changing this file)

2004-08-14 15:14  zmoelnig

	* prelaminary windoze support (not tested at all, just from
	  guessing)

2004-08-10 14:42  zmoelnig

	* do not use GEM_EXPORT (as it needs other GemExportDef.h to be
	  included

2004-08-10 11:43  zmoelnig

	* an object to render into external displays (this is: the context
	  is *not* handled by Gem but by an external application)

2004-08-10 11:40  zmoelnig

	* oje: "tagged" instead of "branched" (anyhow gemwindow_qtExt is
	  already deprecated)

2004-08-09 19:36  zmoelnig

	* initial makefile for [gemwindow_qtExt]

2004-08-09 19:36  zmoelnig

	* initial output-module: [gemwindow_qtExt] (what an ugly name!) to
	  render to external qt-contexts

2004-08-09 13:23  zmoelnig

	* re-enabled checking, whether we already have a const context

2004-08-09 11:19  zmoelnig

	* oops: bufferMess() was doubled

2004-08-09 10:34  zmoelnig

	* implementation of bufferMess

2004-08-09 10:33  zmoelnig

	* enabled use of shared contexts on platforms other than osX (which
	  had it already)

2004-08-08 19:49  zmoelnig

	* removed unneeded variables (like m_windowRun and m_windowNumber)

2004-08-08 19:24  zmoelnig

	* use GemState->screenWidth instead of GemMan::m_width (and vice
	  versa for m_height)

2004-08-08 14:38  zmoelnig

	* changed GemState->stereo to GemState->doUpdate

2004-08-08 14:01  zmoelnig

	* removed traces of GemMan

2004-08-08 13:51  zmoelnig

	* set the viewpoint use GemState->windowWidth/Height instead of
	  GemMan::width/height

2004-08-08 13:45  zmoelnig

	* set the viewpoint immediately (do *not* use GemMan::m_view)

2004-08-08 13:39  zmoelnig

	* add field for window-dimensions to the GemState

2004-08-08 13:37  zmoelnig

	* add the window-dimensions to the GemState

2004-08-07 19:29  zmoelnig

	* made it run under NT

2004-08-07 18:18  zmoelnig

	* made the mousemotion-callback work under nt

2004-08-07 10:25  zmoelnig

	* the motionCallback for mouse) now reports the window-dimensions
	  too (for scaling/normalization)

2004-08-07 10:24  zmoelnig

	* changed (renamed) the render-functions a bit

2004-08-07 09:16  zmoelnig

	* forgot to add [gemcontrol] (?)

2004-08-06 18:51  zmoelnig

	* trying to save the constContext (LATER think about "sharing"
	  contexts)

2004-08-06 18:07  zmoelnig

	* stop rendering when the last [gemcontrol] has vanished

2004-08-06 17:18  zmoelnig

	* "lighting" now works individually for each GemOutput

2004-08-06 17:17  zmoelnig

	* added "fsaa"

2004-08-06 16:08  zmoelnig

	* [gemcontrol] now registers to GemMan to get the render-clock

2004-08-06 16:07  zmoelnig

	* "reset"-message

2004-08-06 16:03  zmoelnig

	* callbacks working under linux

2004-08-06 12:20  zmoelnig

	* stripped down and moved a lot of code into GemOutput and
	  [gemwindow]

2004-08-06 12:20  zmoelnig

	* loads of functionality from [gemwin] and GemBase moved into this
	  one: color,fog,viewpoint,....

2004-08-06 12:18  zmoelnig

	* first output...

2004-08-05 19:57  zmoelnig

	* drawType reset to 0 instead of NULL

2004-08-05 14:33  zmoelnig

	* put the actual render-callback into doRender()

2004-08-05 14:32  zmoelnig

	* added object-arguments for initial xsize/ysize

2004-08-05 14:19  zmoelnig

	* add a check whether we have a NormalsArray (prevents crashes with
	  [vertex_quad] and [vertex_grid])

2004-08-04 09:19  zmoelnig

	* made the "offset"-message understand 2(X,Y,0,0), 3(X,Y,Z,0) or
	  4(X,Y,Z,W) arguments

2004-08-04 09:18  zmoelnig

	* removed code that came apparently from [vertex_offset] (and was
	  not used anyhow)

2004-08-04 09:17  zmoelnig

	* now color_set inherits from GemBase instead of GemShape; "color"
	  can now have 1 (greyscale), 3(RGB) or 4(rgba) values

2004-08-04 08:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos which prevented vc6 to succeed

2004-08-04 08:32  zmoelnig

	* now you can give a list of directories on the command-line to
	  override the default directories where we want the
	  Make.source,... to be built

2004-08-04 08:29  zmoelnig

	* on windows we have to include <windows.h> before <GL/gl.h>,...

	* made it compile under linux

2004-08-03 21:35  zmoelnig

	* included Base/GemVertex.h instead of GemShape.h; btw. i don't
	  think that GemShape is a good parent-class

2004-08-03 21:33  zmoelnig

	* removed some stupidities

2004-08-03 21:25  zmoelnig

2004-08-03 16:07  zmoelnig

	* an output-object to replace [gemwin] on the long-run; no
	  functionality yet!!

2004-08-03 15:52  zmoelnig

	* the parent-class for different output-objects

2004-08-03 09:17  zmoelnig

	* the Release-binary under windoze used to crash when a pix_video
	  was created; defining "DEBUG" on the correct place gets rid of
	  this. (indeed an ugly workaround)

2004-08-03 09:15  zmoelnig

	* type-cast 0xFF to shut up vc6

2004-08-03 09:11  zmoelnig

2004-08-03 08:22  zmoelnig

	* type-cast 0xFF to shut up vc6

2004-07-29 20:21  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX (faster when alpha is set to anything; BUT slower if
	  alpha is 0x00 or 0xFF)

	* added __MMX__

2004-07-29 10:16  zmoelnig

	* round() is not available on vc6; using (short)-casts instead

2004-07-28 14:24  zmoelnig

	* added some hints for compilers

2004-07-28 11:19  zmoelnig

	* MMX for YUV

2004-07-28 11:18  zmoelnig

	* if ne SSE2 is defined, it defaults to MMX

2004-07-27 22:16  zmoelnig

	* a bit of a comment

2004-07-27 22:06  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-support (RGBA only; seems to be slower than generic
	  code !!!)

2004-07-27 21:00  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-support

2004-07-27 15:58  zmoelnig

2004-07-26 18:37  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-support (grayscale only)

2004-07-26 18:36  zmoelnig

	* made it YUV-MMX faster (???)

2004-07-24 20:08  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-support; note however, that it is slower than i
	  expected; furthermore negative coefficients are not handled
	  correctly

2004-07-24 18:42  zmoelnig

	* don't copy the "datasize" with copy2imageStruct - as it should
	  only be used internally for pdata; (THIS MIGHT BREAK THINGS!!)

2004-07-23 18:36  zmoelnig

	* fixed MMX code for RGBA/YUV/Gray

2004-07-23 17:26  zmoelnig

	* fixed RGBA-MMX code

2004-07-23 10:25  zmoelnig

2004-07-01 21:00  zmoelnig

	* file GemSIMD.h was added on branch vertex_array on 2005-08-19
	  14:18:07 +0000

2004-07-01 21:00  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-code; includes for the various
	  platforms/SIMD-optimization should be handled in here

2004-07-01 20:58  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-code; SIMD-optimized functions are called directly
	  from GemPixObj; if they are not overridden by the child, the
	  default function for this colourspace is called

2004-07-01 20:57  zmoelnig

	* initial MMX-code

2004-07-01 15:59  zmoelnig

	* replace GL_LINE_LOOP with GL_LINE_STRIP (thanks to cyrille) made
	  the "draw"-message-handling a bit more flexible

2004-06-30 16:34  zmoelnig

	* when reset()ing, use the current action instead of HILLFOUR

2004-06-30 16:32  zmoelnig

	* rebuild the texture when switching between rectangle and
	  normalized textures

2004-06-30 14:18  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed the texturing for rectangle textures; added a
	  "texture"-message to choose between normal and spheric texturing

2004-06-30 14:13  zmoelnig

	* used debug() instead of post() for the "client-storage"-message

2004-06-30 14:11  zmoelnig

	* using RGB24 instead of RGB32, because the alpha-channel is set to
	  0 by RGB32(!!)

2004-06-25 19:38  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug that did not texture rectangle images correctly
	  texture mode can now be set via a "texture"-mess (spherical or
	  not) texturing of line/point enabled (buggy output ?)

2004-06-25 19:31  zmoelnig

	* "not using client-texture" is now a debug-message (instead of
	  post())

2004-05-28 13:50  zmoelnig

	* updated for 0.90

2004-05-26 12:59  zmoelnig

	* now the "release" compiles

2004-05-26 12:35  zmoelnig

	* changed version from 0.888 to 0.90

2004-05-26 12:34  zmoelnig

	* fixed "installation" for on windows

2004-05-26 12:34  zmoelnig

	* changed from 0.888pre2 to 0.90

2004-05-19 17:57  zmoelnig

	* changed the shifts to SHIFT_* to make it cross-platform

2004-05-19 17:25  tigital

	* [no log message]

2004-05-19 17:17  tigital

	* here's what I came up with:  luma seems more sensitive, and makes
	  a better image, tho different than the rgba version

2004-05-16 21:22  zmoelnig

	* fixed some issues with compiling Gem on windows with nvidia's
	  openGL-headers (have to include glext.h)

2004-05-15 19:59  zmoelnig

	* noted that pix_lumaoffset might crash with high offset-factors

2004-05-14 19:20  zmoelnig

	* added a "yuv"-message to turn off direct YUV-texturing even if it
	  is available (because our G4 with a geforce4MX says that it can
	  do GL_ycbcr but actually the images look weird

2004-05-14 19:05  zmoelnig

	* added range-checking for the offset when doing smoothed & filled
	  processing; this should fix the crashes at very high offsets on
	  all colorspaces

2004-05-14 17:42  zmoelnig

	* fixed YUV on big-endians

2004-05-13 19:25  zmoelnig

	* don't copy "pdata" with copyImage2Struct; pdata should always(!)
	  be a pointer to some data that is owned by the image itself! this
	  fixes the abiding crashes when deleting pix_-objects

2004-05-10 10:08  zmoelnig

	* added additional error-checks and a sanity-check on close();
	  should run now on QT-6.5 (as (un)stable as with QT-6.4)

2004-05-10 07:03  cclepper

	* First step at separating the color-space functions in order to
	  have them work properly.  RGBA is still ok, and now YUV works on
	  'uniform' adjustments.

2004-05-10 05:54  cclepper

	* #ifdef to remove YUV code on OSX.  maybe someone will write a
	  version that doesn't crash?

2004-05-09 09:03  cclepper

	* changed the shifts for YUV output.  now 100% less green.

2004-05-08 06:19  cclepper

	* fixed the 'it's oh so green' YUV problem on OSX

2004-05-07 19:51  zmoelnig

	* made defines for shifts on mac/non-mac (although they don't do
	  much now)

2004-05-07 19:48  zmoelnig

	* added U8 as another type

2004-05-07 19:41  zmoelnig

	* using ch*-constants rather than hardcoded positions of
	  channel-data (e.g: chRed instead of 0)

2004-05-07 19:37  zmoelnig

	* shut up macOS-gcc compiler warnings

2004-05-07 17:42  zmoelnig

	* type fixing to shut down the compiler

2004-05-07 15:52  zmoelnig

	* made Grey work

2004-05-07 14:02  zmoelnig

	* made YUV and Grey work

2004-05-07 10:41  zmoelnig

	* use setCsizeByFormat use reallocate() instead of clear() and
	  allocate() and complicated checks

2004-05-07 10:40  zmoelnig

	* fixed stupid typo

2004-05-07 10:40  zmoelnig

	* replaced hardcoded shift-amount by SHIFT_Y.  use setCsizeByFormat
	  use reallocate() instead of clear() and allocate()

2004-05-07 10:30  zmoelnig

	* use setCsizeByFormat use reallocate() instead of clear() and
	  allocate() removed unused variable

2004-05-07 10:29  zmoelnig

	* use setCsizeByFormat use reallocate() instead of clear() and
	  allocate()

2004-05-07 10:28  zmoelnig

	* removed the commented out the processGray-function (and not only
	  it's body); use setCsizeByFormat

2004-05-07 10:14  zmoelnig

	* don't initialize to small images (64x64) any more as this is only
	  for memory fragmentation

2004-05-07 10:12  zmoelnig

	* using setCsizeByFormat rather than setting csize/format/type
	  directly

2004-05-07 10:11  zmoelnig

	* made YUV work on PCs (and used better namings (like "U" instead
	  of "Red")

2004-05-06 12:01  zmoelnig

	* setting the csize/format/type of the image more intelligently

2004-05-06 11:36  zmoelnig

	* another step towards a working version.  now yuv/rgba/grey
	  almost(!) behave the same

2004-05-06 11:35  zmoelnig

	* the RGBA2LUMA conversion was wrong

2004-05-05 16:56  zmoelnig

	* made YUV work correctly

2004-05-05 16:56  zmoelnig

	* use run-time checks for YUV-texturing

2004-05-05 16:55  zmoelnig

	* added run-time checks for GL_APPLE_ycbcr_422 (YUV-texturing)

2004-05-05 16:54  zmoelnig

	* use normal memory-allocation (no alignment tricks as these
	  produces weird output) LATER make sure that memory is aligned
	  correctly

2004-05-04 22:20  zmoelnig

	* quick hack to make Grey/YUV work

2004-05-04 17:30  zmoelnig

	* initialized orgPixBlock to NULL (should fix crashes when no
	  upstream image is present)

2004-05-04 14:46  zmoelnig

	* seems to work now with RGBA/YUV/Grayscale

2004-05-04 10:15  zmoelnig

	* added bugs concerning win32-movie-loading

2004-05-03 18:27  zmoelnig

	* used SHIFT_Y1,... (from GemPixPete.h) as my images were green ;-)

2004-05-03 18:26  zmoelnig

	* defined SHIFT_Y1,... for YUV-shifting

2004-05-03 08:15  cclepper

	* fixed up the YUV code - rolled a new black function and tests for
	  proper pixel values

2004-05-03 08:14  tigital

	* YUV works better:  but it's about half the width resolution as it
	  should be...at least it's not green ;-)

2004-05-03 04:08  tigital

	* removed void to shut up gcc

2004-05-03 03:42  tigital

	* YUV processing functions correctly now

2004-04-24 17:02  zmoelnig

	* removed some more verbosity...

2004-04-23 16:41  zmoelnig

	* moved some fsaa-code from apple-only to openGL-dependent code
	  (read: changed ifdefs)

2004-04-21 06:32  tigital

	* YUV is almost fixed:	at least we're dealing with true luma...but
	  there still seems to be a pixel skipping problem

2004-04-21 05:52  cclepper

	* changed GetLuminance() coefficients to correct vaules

2004-04-20 19:55  zmoelnig

	* fixed the default viewpoint-values to the correct ones "0 0 4"
	  instead of "0 0 -4"

2004-04-10 02:13  tigital

	* [OSX] added header for definition of UInt32 after the mass
	  movement of functions

2004-04-09 11:38  zmoelnig

	* added the [pix_texture2]-alias again.  why has it vanished ?

2004-04-08 14:20  zmoelnig

	* moved utility functions (namely: powerOfTwo()) into
	  Base/GemFuncUtil

2004-04-08 13:57  zmoelnig

	* moved utility functions (namely: powerOfTwo()) into
	  Base/GemFuncUtil

2004-04-08 13:54  zmoelnig

	* structured the location of functions a bit: GemPixObj does not
	  hold any utility functions GemFuncUtil holds general untilities
	  (like powerOfTwo()) GemPixUtil holds utility functions for image
	  manipulation (only!) GemPixPete (NEW) holds functions from
	  pete's_plugins (specialzied PixUtil-functions)

2004-04-08 13:51  zmoelnig

	* added some comments

2004-04-08 13:51  zmoelnig

	  pull-mechanism works

2004-04-08 13:43  zmoelnig

	* removed unused variables

2004-04-07 19:33  zmoelnig

2004-04-07 19:20  zmoelnig

	* fixed the alpha-channel

2004-04-07 19:20  zmoelnig

	* added some more verbosity on errors (so we know, where the error
	  occured)

2004-04-07 18:09  tigital

	* quick n'dirty camera help patch...will flesh out tonight?

2004-04-07 18:08  zmoelnig

2004-04-07 18:07  zmoelnig

	* removed unused variable G

2004-04-07 18:04  tigital

	* added YUV support (kinda):  it works, but isn't precisely correct
	  yet (especially in pix_objects that are color based; displacement
	  objects are less-obviously incorrect)

2004-04-07 18:02  tigital

	* added YUV support (kinda):  it works, but isn't precisely correct
	  yet

2004-04-07 16:47  zmoelnig

	* added switchable support for FSAA under linux with nvidia-cards

2004-04-07 16:03  zmoelnig

	* added 2nd argument for number of slices fixed the draw-type

2004-04-07 13:08  zmoelnig

	* added second argument (number of slices) the re-creation of the
	  sphere is now triggered by a change in state->texture too

2004-04-07 12:28  zmoelnig

	* the processGray tried to convert the image from RGB to RGBA
	  in-place.  i have no idea, how this code made it into the
	  [pix_alpha]

2004-04-07 11:12  zmoelnig

	* removed the non-mac specific part in the fullscreen-message (no
	  one really cares if the fullscreen-flag is bool or int)

2004-04-07 11:03  zmoelnig

	* all the CPPExtern-objects now no their own class-name, which is
	  stored in m_objectname error-messages report this name

	* removed commenting out of m_colorspace

2004-04-04 19:45  cclepper

	* client_storage is now off by default to avoid texture corruption
	  problems when using pix_film in 'auto 1' mode on OSX.  setting
	  individual frames still works fine with client_storage however.

2004-04-04 19:43  cclepper

	* added OSX specific handling of the 'fullscreen' message to
	  accommodate multiple displays

2004-04-03 20:34  zmoelnig

	* fixed the help-patches (mainly removed the "auto 1" message from
	  [pix_buf] as it was absolutely non-sense

2004-04-03 02:06  cclepper

	* removed most of the debug messages.

2004-04-03 01:27  cclepper

	* now has functioning code on OSX

	* fixed some includes (?)

2004-04-02 08:43  zmoelnig

	* included the Base/config.h so we get the HAVE_DIRECTSHOW define
	  when appropriate set the help-symbol of the directshow-version of
	  pix_video to [pix_videoDS] (since the api is so different)

2004-04-02 00:00  tigital

	* [OSX] now the mouse can be hidden/shown via the cursor 0/1
	  message

2004-04-01 20:52  tigital

	* [OSX] finally figure out how to get mouse coords to be the same
	  whether or not there is a title bar, and no matter where the
	  window is on the desktop...also solves the "go to {0,0} when
	  mouse leaves window" problem!

2004-03-31 07:33  tigital

	* shut up a warning: can't have /* inside a comment

2004-03-31 07:25  tigital

	* [OSX] shut up some warnings

2004-03-29 20:57  zmoelnig

2004-03-29 20:48  zmoelnig

	* finally removed the YUV-stuff (should have been done for ages)

2004-03-29 20:45  zmoelnig

2004-03-29 18:02  zmoelnig

	* accidentially the button-state was reported to be "1" when
	  released (like on press); fixed

2004-03-29 18:01  zmoelnig

	* type change to get rid of compiler-warning under macOS

2004-03-29 18:00  zmoelnig

	* compiled it and therefore updated my project files

2004-03-29 08:43  zmoelnig

	* added includes for NT

2004-03-29 08:12  cclepper

	* changed the render function to only calculate the geometry when
	  the geometry changes.  results in at least a 3X speedup.

2004-03-26 07:40  cclepper

	* initialized the Y,U,V variables to 0.  no more random color
	  fields on loading a patch with pix_offset.

2004-03-25 20:57  tigital

	* [OSX]-only:  standardized mouse location to "window relative":
	  however, remember that (0,0) is always the top left corner,
	  whether or not there is a title bar/border

2004-03-25 18:22  zmoelnig

	* added a magic-number to the GemCache to ensure that the cache is
	  valid

2004-03-25 13:12  zmoelnig

	* initialize GemCache on creation, so we can dynamically create
	  [gemhead]s and they will start rendering without having to
	  restart the engine

2004-03-25 11:03  zmoelnig

	* removed another post()

2004-03-24 22:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the "drawing all groups" messages

2004-03-24 22:10  zmoelnig

	* added a reset()-method to re-set an instance without having to
	  destroy and re-create it (see [gemhead])

2004-03-24 22:08  zmoelnig

	* each gemhead now has an instance of the GemCache that is only
	  reset when rendering is started (instead of being destroyed and
	  re-created) hopefully this fixes some memory bug.

2004-03-24 18:27  zmoelnig

	* added, since needed for debugging

2004-03-24 14:20  zmoelnig

	* fixed initial materials (ambient, specular, diffuse, shininess,
	  emission)

2004-03-24 12:47  zmoelnig

	* added auto-(re)loading of fonts when rendering is started fixed
	  some cleanup-issues

2004-03-24 12:41  zmoelnig

	* removed "done" message

2004-03-22 23:31  tigital

	* [OSX]-only:  [gemwin] now correctly responds to the following
	  messages:  border & title; also fixed keyboard character input
	  for [gemkeyname]

2004-03-21 20:58  zmoelnig

	* readded help-patches

2004-03-21 20:53  zmoelnig

	* removed to check in as "binary" again

2004-03-21 20:52  zmoelnig

	* updated help-patches

2004-03-21 14:39  zmoelnig

	* fixed rectangle textureing

2004-03-20 21:42  zmoelnig

	* fixed bugs

2004-03-20 21:36  zmoelnig

	* rolled the GLU code directly into the objects to enable rectangle
	  textures

2004-03-20 17:42  zmoelnig

	* cleaned GLUT-removal code a bit

2004-03-20 17:06  zmoelnig

	* removed dependencies on GLUT [teapot] is now "built-in"

2004-03-19 20:52  zmoelnig

	* updated help-patches removed all traces of [pix_texture2]

2004-03-19 20:12  zmoelnig

	* updated help-patches

2004-03-19 20:09  zmoelnig

	* added grayscale support

2004-03-19 18:00  zmoelnig

	* removed the "maximum number of control points" restriction (so
	  now, we can have 1000s of control points in polygon/curve)

2004-03-19 16:01  zmoelnig

	* new help-patches (e.g: working examples)

2004-03-19 16:00  zmoelnig

	* added a method "width" for the linewidth (compatibility with
	  other geos)

2004-03-19 15:58  zmoelnig

	* changed the helpsymbol

2004-03-19 15:54  zmoelnig

	* got the mapping from mac-buttons to gem-buttons right (hopefully)

2004-03-19 12:47  zmoelnig

	* randF is only an alias for randomF; there shouldn't be a separate
	  help-file

2004-03-18 17:51  zmoelnig

	* the mac-spefific button-offset has been moved to GemWinCreateMac

2004-03-17 21:04  zmoelnig

	* force auto-registering when appropriate

2004-03-17 21:02  zmoelnig

	* set the "newfilm"-flag when a new film is loaded

2004-03-17 20:58  zmoelnig

	* tried to fix rectangle textures

2004-03-16 20:41  zmoelnig

	* tried to fix rectangle textures

2004-03-16 02:16  tigital

	* OSX only:  forgot to "return noErr" in event loop!

2004-03-15 14:35  zmoelnig

	* small bug-fix: a unity gain of "1" was translated to 255>>8
	  (which is less than 1 and led to fading feed-backs)

2004-03-13 10:10  cclepper

	* fixed #ifdefs

2004-03-10 18:32  zmoelnig

	* changed the configure-process GemLibs can now be specified with
	  "--gemlibs" additional search-paths for ALL libraries can be
	  specified with "--libdir"

2004-03-10 18:07  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'd the altivec code with __VEC__

2004-03-10 18:03  zmoelnig

	* added the HELPSYMBOL-BASE "Gem/", so the help-patches will work,
	  even though this object inherits from CPPExtern and not from
	  GemBase

2004-03-10 17:55  zmoelnig

	* pix_depot and friends are now in pix_buffer et al.

2004-03-10 17:04  zmoelnig

	* added a new justification "BASE" that does no justification at
	  all; usefull, if you want a constant base-line.

2004-03-07 19:49  cclepper

	* new fullscreen code for 10.3 which is good.  the window deletion
	  routine does crash every 10-20 iterations though, which is bad.

2004-03-01 02:29  cclepper

	* added some more cache hints - 45% percent faster

2004-03-01 02:02  cclepper

	* I think this fixes the majority of playback problems on OSX.
	  Movie loading is faster, playback is smoother using 'rate $1'.

2004-03-01 01:58  cclepper

	* just a cleaning

2004-03-01 01:55  cclepper

	* slightly tweaked Altivec (load hoisting)

2004-03-01 01:52  cclepper

	* added some Altivec for YUV

2004-03-01 01:50  cclepper

	* slightly better altivec.

2004-02-29 06:24  cclepper

	* an improved window bounds fix.  still need to find a workaround
	  for the fullscreen on 10.3 though

2004-02-25 07:25  cclepper

	* split processing into RGBA and YUV portions.	added Altivec for
	  YUV.

2004-02-16 20:07  zmoelnig

	* added path-searching for fonts.  so you can add your systems
	  favorite font-path and get a lot of other TrueType-faces

2004-02-16 05:06  cclepper

	* changed float to int processing in the YUV code - now 10X faster.

2004-02-15 19:32  cclepper

	* this should fix the window bounds problem.

2004-02-13 15:09  zmoelnig

	* hopefully got the reference-types allright ("relative" instead of
	  "absolute")

2004-02-13 15:06  zmoelnig

	* updated my project

2004-02-12 18:31  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug with filename-searching

2004-02-12 18:28  zmoelnig

	* added better support for firewire under linux (thanks to franz
	  hildgen)

2004-02-12 18:25  zmoelnig

	* fixed a type that prevented this from being compiled

2004-02-10 13:36  zmoelnig

	* now the gemwindow can be created even if we only have DirectColor
	  (instead of TrueColor); however i haven't bothered yet with
	  setting up the Palettes.

2004-02-10 13:27  zmoelnig

	* added a newline at end of file

2004-02-10 13:24  zmoelnig

	* more friendly output of the "create window" message

2004-02-10 11:47  zmoelnig

	* - added ErrorHandling, so Gem doesn't crash if the
	  display-/window-context has vanished before we try to destroy the
	  gemwindow - removed checking for ModLines on remote displays;
	  this used to crash; unfortunately this disables fullscreen on
	  remote displays

2004-02-10 11:23  zmoelnig

	* added and disabled Guenter at the splash-screen (again)

2004-02-06 13:10  zmoelnig

	* BUGFIX: used to crash when no model was loaded and trying to
	  apply a texture.  (at least if NDEBUG was not defined)

2004-02-06 13:08  zmoelnig

	* as ben has pointed out, there seems to be a bug when rendering to
	  non-square windows: everything get's distorted (say: on 640x480 a
	  square would be a rectangle with a 4/3-aspect); since i think
	  this might break a lot of things (?), i have left the old default
	  behaviour but you can turn off compatibility with "compat 0"

2004-02-05 19:17  zmoelnig

	* updated my vc-project it now compiles with FTGL

2004-02-05 19:16  zmoelnig

	* moved the defines for the platforms (e.g: whether macos uses
	  FTGL) into the appropriate config*.h files

2004-02-02 12:19  zmoelnig

	* all docu is done; but we need to compile it under windows with
	  FTGL support (i failed...)

2004-02-02 12:18  zmoelnig

	* updated my project

2004-02-02 12:15  zmoelnig

	* put QT-loader *after* the AVI-loader, because QT sometimes
	  crashes when having loaded AVI's and tries to load QT's
	  afterwards.  so AVI is now handled by the built in (for win)
	  routines, and QuickTime is only used if it fails

2004-02-02 12:13  zmoelnig

	* post "video4linux" and remove post of "fish" ;-)

2004-02-02 12:12  zmoelnig

	* added some support for devices not handled by devfs; added
	  upside-down flag decode RGBA by hand (since otherwise we would
	  decode YUV->RGB->RGBA, all in software...)

2004-02-02 12:11  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed the inclusion of m_pd.h to make sure it is not included
	  double (breaks with old version of pd)

2004-02-02 12:08  zmoelnig

	* exported the CVector class, since vc complaint about this
	  (probably this will break future things...)

2004-02-02 12:06  zmoelnig

	* hopefully fixed fromUYVY since it did mix up U and V when
	  decoding dv-streams

2004-02-02 12:04  zmoelnig

	* fixed types to keep compiler silent

2004-02-02 12:03  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed everything to be __APPLE__ only

2004-01-31 07:55  cclepper

	* new pix_movie for OSX.  uses an optimized path for movie playing
	  and texturing.

2004-01-29 02:59  tigital

	* initialized variables to shutup compiler warnings

2004-01-28 17:06  tigital

	* OSX only:  added carbon event processing to
	  dispatchGemWindowMessages() (Finally!)

2004-01-28 17:02  tigital

	* added mouse wheel support, though there is no outlet (yet)

2004-01-28 16:59  tigital

	* added mouse wheel support OSX only:  added support for correct
	  mouse buttons

2004-01-28 16:54  tigital

	* OSX only:  added event handler support for window, mouse and
	  keyboard events (ie. [gemmouse] and [gemkeyboard]), plus the
	  window now behaves in a standard gui manner

2004-01-28 05:46  cclepper

	* fixed a little problem with newImage being multiply defined

2004-01-27 18:13  zmoelnig

	* re-removed them (somehow they reappeared in the CVS; guess it has
	  to do with sourceforge's server-sync)

2004-01-21 17:50  zmoelnig

	* added support for rectangle textures even with sphereMaps
	  ("texture 1")

2004-01-20 09:13  cclepper

	* added support for rectangle textures to glm

2004-01-09 11:32  zmoelnig

	* updated my vc-project

2004-01-09 11:31  zmoelnig

	* updated fixed bugs

2004-01-09 06:09  tigital

	* values should be "TimeValue", not int's (shuts up compiler
	  warnings)

2004-01-09 05:27  tigital

	* added (int *) casts to fscanf() calls to shutup compiler (someone
	  had to do it!)

2004-01-08 20:16  zmoelnig

	* hmm: probably new linebreaks

2004-01-08 20:07  zmoelnig

	* YUV-support fixed (the image looks "different" (squashed) than
	  RGBA, but at least it is functional and not crashing any more),
	  Grayscale works great

2004-01-08 20:03  zmoelnig

	* i think, all objects are documented (somehow: some help-patches
	  are rather crude)

2004-01-08 20:02  zmoelnig

	* several BUG-fixes (esp: put the pivot-point of rubber/ripple into
	  the center; made the sizeMess-work; use normalized coordinates
	  for rubber (now independent of the window-dimensions)

2004-01-08 19:58  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2004-01-05 20:13  zmoelnig

	* updated docs

2004-01-05 20:08  zmoelnig

	* use a movie rather than an image for demonstrating this

2004-01-05 19:37  zmoelnig

	* added newImage-variable since it was needed

2004-01-05 19:35  zmoelnig

	* removed a debug message

2004-01-05 19:34  zmoelnig

	* added an include for windows

2004-01-05 19:20  zmoelnig

	* re-added inlets for height, size and mode transformed and scaled
	  the newWave so that it behaves exactly like a square of the same
	  dimension when there is no motion.

	  ASK: why is this "blend" function in there ?

2004-01-05 12:08  zmoelnig

	* better checks for pd-version

2004-01-05 11:18  zmoelnig

	* glu-objects (like sphere) have a bit of a problem with
	  non-power-of-2 textures

2004-01-05 10:58  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2004-01-05 10:42  zmoelnig

	* my project-builder project has been updated

2004-01-05 10:41  zmoelnig

	* updated doc

2004-01-05 10:28  zmoelnig

	* fixed typos

2004-01-05 10:23  zmoelnig

	* use integer calcs rather than floating point

2004-01-04 19:56  zmoelnig

	* bugfix (videoV4L crashed when you tried to open a non-existant
	  device)

2004-01-04 19:53  zmoelnig

	* added checks for the pd-version (because of reference
	  install-paths)

2004-01-04 19:51  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2004-01-04 19:48  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2003-12-31 03:54  cclepper

	* added support for groups

2003-12-31 03:49  cclepper

	* yet another rewrite of the QT tasking code.  this should
	  hopefully give the 'best of both worlds'.

2003-12-17 07:21  cclepper

	* added the real frame counting method and made improvements to
	  using the counter method of playback - no double processed frames

2003-12-17 07:13  tigital

	* rearranged variables to shut up gcc 3.3 about initialization

2003-12-17 07:13  tigital

	* removed unused vector to shut up gcc 3.3

2003-12-17 07:11  tigital

	* added Cyrille's changes:  now it's more controllable (and
	  useful):  see examples/07.texture/05.newWave.pd

2003-12-17 07:05  tigital

	* added Cyrille's changes:  now it's more controllable (and
	  useful):  see examples/07.texture/05.newWave.pd

2003-12-12 19:21  zmoelnig

	* dos2unix -- linebreaks

2003-12-10 03:18  cclepper

	* rewrite to make playback using 'auto' more efficient.  'rate'
	  message sets the playback speed when using 'auto' mode.  the
	  movie rate is properly set for correct qt playback.  new doDebug
	  for handling internal state info display to the console.

2003-12-08 07:02  cclepper

	* added hiquality message to deal with DV streams (yeah i know it's
	  ass backwards to disable hiquality to make DV streams look good)

2003-12-07 03:47  cclepper

	* changed internal texture format back to RGBA so now alpha works
	  in textures

2003-12-06 06:04  cclepper

	* default is now set to YUV colorspace

2003-12-04 18:57  zmoelnig

	* new help-patch from cyrille

2003-12-04 18:53  zmoelnig

	* reviewed help-patches

2003-12-04 14:18  zmoelnig

	* bugfix: one additional inlet was created for [primTri], [curve]
	  and [polygon] by GemShape.  i have added a new creator for
	  GemShape (without arguments) that will not create the
	  "size"-inlet - this is for objects that want only the "draw" and
	  "width" message

2003-12-04 13:19  zmoelnig

	* the bugfix for Grey-support needs a header-file too...

2003-12-03 14:21  zmoelnig

	* BUGFIX: grayscale was missing

2003-12-03 08:18  cclepper

	* made client_storage a user defined option.  this is a temporary
	  workaround to some texture corruption issues.

2003-12-02 16:26  zmoelnig

	* my new windows-project

2003-12-02 16:26  zmoelnig

	* filed YUV-bug of pix_kaleidoscope

2003-12-02 16:22  zmoelnig

	* added dummy messages for "enumerate" and "dialog" (used by
	  pix_videoDS, in the future probably by others...)

2003-12-02 16:21  zmoelnig

	* "dialog" with no args is now the same as "setup" ("setup" message
	  should be deprecated)

2003-12-02 16:20  zmoelnig

	* added dummy messages for "enumerate" and "dialog" (used by
	  pix_videoDS)

2003-12-02 16:19  zmoelnig

	* upside down

2003-12-02 16:18  zmoelnig

	* support for colour-space switching

2003-12-02 16:18  zmoelnig

	* use __NEW_FILM rather than __NEW__

2003-12-02 16:17  zmoelnig

	* colourspace-switching with GL_* rather than 0 (YUV) and 1 (RGBA)

2003-12-02 16:16  zmoelnig

	* a bit of support for colourspace-switching

2003-12-02 16:15  zmoelnig

	* made it a bit more stable on windos

2003-12-02 16:14  zmoelnig

	* added some braces to make execution order clearer

2003-12-02 15:57  zmoelnig

	* split __NEW__ in __VIDEO_NEW and __FILM_NEW

2003-12-02 07:36  cclepper

	* changed in to GLint to match prototype of csMess

2003-12-02 06:38  cclepper

	* fixed error in code - it now compiles

2003-12-01 15:48  zmoelnig

	* once in a while i compile under NT...

2003-12-01 15:47  zmoelnig

	* configLinux.h should be generated for all machines by the
	  configure-script.  don't know, how this came into the CVS

2003-12-01 15:27  zmoelnig

	* another bug fixed for NT

2003-12-01 15:19  zmoelnig

	* rebuilt configure to add the "-l" flags

2003-12-01 15:05  zmoelnig

	* rebuilt it with another version of "aclocal"

2003-12-01 14:55  zmoelnig

	* another bugfix (pix_videoDS) reported

2003-12-01 14:52  zmoelnig

	* updated bugfixes ("create" on remote X-servers works for most but
	  my machine)

2003-12-01 14:48  zmoelnig

	* bugfix: configure wouldn't add "-l" flags for "standard"
	  libraries found with AC_FIND_LIB

2003-12-01 11:09  zmoelnig

	* removed swapMess() and dimenMess() - should be handled by the
	  parent-class

	  removed explicit-call to the parent's setupCallback; should be
	  handled via CPPExtern.

	  turned on capturing for device 0 by default.

	  Callback() now returns NOERROR instead of S_FALSE: i don't know
	  why we would want to stop grabbing::i only got 1 frame and it
	  stopped; now i can grab moving images ! messages:

	  the pixBlock-array is now called m_pixBlockBuf[]; m_pixBlock is
	  another pixBlock that gets the data on "render()" via fromBGR().
	  LATER: add other functions to let users select the color-space
	  via the setup-dialog

	  added a "colorspace" message, that sets the output-colorspace
	  (not the capturing one!)

	  made the "device" message an alias for "open" (because of
	  compatibility to pix_videoNEW) made the "dialog"-message (without
	  arguments) an alias for "setup", because this gives us one (1)
	  interface to popup-dialogs.

	  LATER: make "dimen", "norm", "channel" work

2003-12-01 10:59  zmoelnig

	* changed the m_colorspace, to not only be 0 (for YUV) and 1(for
	  RGBA) but rather GL_YCBCR422_GEM and GL_RGBA

2003-12-01 10:56  zmoelnig

	* if we HAVE_DIRECTSHOW, we disable the AUTO_REGISTER  stuff, if(!)
	  DO_AUTO_REGISTER_CLASS is not defined.  pix_videoDS will define
	  the DO_AUTO..., to register itself

	  this is *very* ugly LATER rethink this

2003-12-01 10:52  zmoelnig

	* removed offsetMess() and swapMess(); should be handled by the
	  parent-class use fromBGR() rather than doing it by hand. this
	  enables other color-spaces too! added a colorspace-message

2003-12-01 10:50  zmoelnig

	* changed the configure a bit to make more intelligent searches in
	  the search-paths, for both libs and headers we now search
	  /usr/local/src and /usr/local/include instead of whole /usr/local
	  (at least for headers)

2003-11-28 19:19  ggeiger

	* fixed alpha depthtest default value

2003-11-25 18:38  zmoelnig

	* support for different colour-spaces

2003-11-25 18:38  zmoelnig

	* support for different colour-spaces (use "colorspace"-message)

2003-11-25 17:54  zmoelnig

	* using setCsizeByFormat() instead of doing this by hand also there
	  is now a m_reqFormat defining the colourspace (but only GL_RGBA
	  is supported....)

2003-11-25 17:52  zmoelnig

	* setCsizeByFormat now also sets the "type" (pixel alignment) on
	  __APPLE__ the default is yuv, everywhere else it is rgba

2003-11-25 17:51  zmoelnig

	* using setCsizeByFormat instead of doing it by hand

2003-11-25 17:28  zmoelnig

	* fixed a stupid bug, that was blacking the "last" buffer each
	  cycle.  added object-arguments as initial parameters take care of
	  colorspace-changes

2003-11-25 16:16  zmoelnig

	* disabled the auto_registering if __NEW__ is not defined exclude
	  "Base/config.h" since it is already included by film.h

2003-11-25 16:14  zmoelnig

	* set the helpsymbol to "pix_film" instead of "pix_filmNEW"
	  uncommented the use of canvas_getfilename since it makes problems
	  with internet-streams (as far as i remember)

2003-11-25 16:09  zmoelnig

	* moved the disabling of auto-register to pix_video.h

2003-11-25 16:07  zmoelnig

	* include "Base/config.h" for all OS (since the config.h will
	  separate the sysdependent things)

2003-11-25 16:06  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the "colorspace"-callback

2003-11-25 16:05  zmoelnig

	* disabled the auto_registering if __NEW__ is defined

2003-11-25 16:04  zmoelnig

	* set the help-symbol to "pix_movie" (instead of "pix_movieNEW")

2003-11-25 16:03  zmoelnig

	* moved the disabling of auto-register to pix_video.h

2003-11-25 16:02  zmoelnig

	* set the help-symbol to "pix_video" (instead of "pix_videoNEW")

2003-11-25 16:01  zmoelnig

	* disabled the auto_registering if __NEW__ is not defined

2003-11-25 16:00  zmoelnig

	* disabled the auto_registering if __NEW__ is defined

2003-11-25 15:59  zmoelnig

	* used setBlack() instead of memset(); use reallocate()

2003-11-25 15:57  zmoelnig

	* setting newfilm to 0 (shouldn't do anything since we are on linux
	  (?))

2003-11-25 15:55  zmoelnig

	* include "Base/config.h" for all OS (since the config.h will
	  separate the sysdependent things) exclude "GemBase.h" and use
	  "m_pd.h" instead (shouldn't be needed either, if it wasn't for
	  post())

2003-11-25 15:54  zmoelnig

	* get more information the last outlet (data) is still the last
	  outlet (but now there are 6 instead of 4). this shouldn't break
	  anything, since who can do something with it ?

2003-11-25 15:53  zmoelnig

	* include "Base/config.h" for all OS (since the config.h will
	  separate the sysdependent things)

2003-11-25 15:51  zmoelnig

	* added "--disable-new" for "old" behaviour with pix_film/pix_video
	  and friends under linux this the config.h.in for linux-autoconf
	  has moved to configLinux.h.in

2003-11-25 15:48  zmoelnig

	* made config.h system-independent.  this the config.h.in for
	  linux-autoconf has moved to configLinux.h.in

2003-11-25 15:46  zmoelnig

	* made config.h system-independent.  the system-bound
	  configurations are stored in separate files (like
	  Base/configLinux.h) which are included by config.h (depending on
	  __linux__ and friends)

2003-11-25 15:43  zmoelnig

	* initialized newfilm/newimage to 0

2003-11-25 15:41  zmoelnig

	* added support for HELPSYMBOL_BASE (which is defined as "Gem/") --
	  used in CPPExtern.h

2003-11-25 15:41  zmoelnig

	* added HELPSYMBOL to set an alternate helpsymbol (it crashes, when
	  more than 1 help-symbols are specified and we already do it here)
	  added support for HELPSYMBOL_BASE (which is defined as "Gem/" in
	  GemBase.h)

2003-11-23 20:27  zmoelnig

	* set notowned=false when color-conversion is done (which is the
	  truth)

2003-11-19 09:53  zmoelnig

	* this is my macOS-projectmaker-project

2003-11-18 20:53  zmoelnig

	* help-patches for [curve3d] and [tube]

2003-11-18 19:21  zmoelnig

	* changed "post()" to "debug()" which is a define to either
	  "post()" or nothing, so we can do some debug-information on
	  demand

2003-11-18 19:18  zmoelnig

	* removed the auto-registering

2003-11-18 19:12  zmoelnig

	* added an alias for "colorspace"-message

2003-11-18 18:47  cclepper

	* new pbproj

2003-11-18 16:39  zmoelnig

	* made XWin be aware of resizes.  however, it doesn't really work
	  yet :-(

2003-11-18 16:36  zmoelnig

	* added MIN and MAX functions

2003-11-18 16:25  zmoelnig

	* added curve3d and tube

2003-11-18 16:21  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2003-11-18 16:20  zmoelnig

	* removed unneeded variables

2003-11-18 16:18  zmoelnig

	* include "config.h" only on linux note: this should be changed
	  LATER to include "config.h" on all platforms.  config.h should
	  then include platform-specific config-files (that can be
	  generated with configure or whatever)

2003-11-18 16:17  zmoelnig

	* defined NO_AUTO_REGISTER_CLASS to not register this class with pd
	  on __linux__, __APPLE__  and NT

2003-11-18 16:14  zmoelnig

	* put the auto_register code in a separate define whichcan be
	  switched off by defining  NO_AUTO_REGISTER_CLASS before including
	  the CPPExtern.h

2003-11-17 19:53  zmoelnig

	* swapped 2 variables in class-definition (apple's gcc likes it
	  better this way) removed unused code

2003-11-15 04:26  cclepper

	* added Altivec function for both RGB and YUV

2003-11-14 15:43  zmoelnig

	* added curve3d and tube

2003-11-14 11:26  zmoelnig

	* added scaling for the mouse-coordinates.  this allows output that
	  is independant of the window-size

2003-11-14 08:21  cclepper

	* removed the extraneous RGB_Altivec prototype

2003-11-14 08:19  cclepper

	* a dst tweak and bug fix

2003-11-13 05:26  cclepper

	* slight change to RGB vector code

2003-11-13 04:38  cclepper

	* added Altivec

2003-11-12 19:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the check, whether the first atom of the text-list is a
	  symbol. now we can print numbers too.

2003-11-12 18:57  zmoelnig

	* changed processRGB_Altivec to processRGBA_Altivec

2003-11-12 18:55  zmoelnig

	* fixed linefeed

2003-11-11 08:31  cclepper

	* added RGB Altivec

2003-11-11 08:04  cclepper

	* added RGB Altivec

2003-11-10 07:37  cclepper

	* changed from float to int processing

2003-11-10 07:18  cclepper

	* changed from float to int processing of grey value

2003-11-10 07:17  cclepper

	* added RGB Altivec

2003-11-10 07:09  cclepper

	* added RGB Altivec

2003-11-10 04:23  cclepper

	* changed Altivec defines

2003-11-10 03:11  cclepper

	* changed Altivec defines

2003-11-03 13:15  zmoelnig

	* changed (bool) to (int), since vc6 doesn't like assigning a
	  boolean-value to an integer.

2003-11-03 13:14  zmoelnig

	* added no-warn-flags for vc6

2003-11-03 13:13  zmoelnig

	* made it compile with ffmpeg-0.4.8 (however i wasn't yet able to
	  load a movie...)

2003-11-03 13:12  zmoelnig

	* made it work under windows; however it likes crashing sometimes
	  and i haven't found out yet why...

2003-10-24 20:38  zmoelnig

	* fixed some BUGS...

2003-10-24 20:32  zmoelnig

	* added "--with-aviplay" as an alias for "--with-avi"

2003-10-24 20:31  zmoelnig

	* added some comment to the render() for neither FTGL/GLTT support
	  (while trying to find out

2003-10-23 10:10  zmoelnig

	* fixed another possible bug (check for NULL-images)

2003-10-22 13:01  zmoelnig

	* added the self-registering code, so that MarkEx will stay
	  available

2003-10-22 11:06  zmoelnig

	* further changes, but far from working yet

2003-10-22 10:35  zmoelnig

	* fixed bugs in pix_buffer_read/pix_buffer_write when no or unknown
	  pix_buffers were specifified

2003-10-22 10:34  zmoelnig

	* added "fsaa" to the WindowHints-class

2003-10-22 07:32  cclepper

	* added FSAA

2003-10-21 20:15  ggeiger

	* remove setup() function this is done through a static class
	  structure now, that is created for each object Gem objects are
	  added automatically to pd as soon as they are compiled in

2003-10-21 20:14  ggeiger

	* re-used continueRender() function

2003-10-21 20:13  ggeiger

	* removed my name from startup

2003-10-21 16:44  ggeiger

	* distribute particles according to their velocity if there is more
	  than one particle per frame

2003-10-21 16:21  ggeiger

	* added numberbox to rotate light (cube seems to be very dark with
	  180)

2003-10-21 16:19  ggeiger

	* added auto message description

2003-10-21 16:17  ggeiger

	* change is in pd already

2003-10-21 15:50  ggeiger

	* bang on gemhead triggers a render cycle (was broken)

2003-10-15 21:07  zmoelnig

	* set the upside-down flag to true. (hope this is alright)

2003-10-15 21:05  zmoelnig

	* temporarily added some variables (like m_auto) these should be
	  gone when i really have access to a machine where quicktime4win
	  is installed

2003-10-15 21:04  zmoelnig

	* fixed a bug when searching for the linker/compiler flags for
	  libavifile: not "avifile-config" is used if available

2003-10-15 21:03  zmoelnig

	* new bugs (pix_buffer, libavifile, remote display)

2003-10-10 14:52  zmoelnig

	* added filmQT changed "#define DEBUG" to "#define debug"

2003-10-10 14:16  zmoelnig

	* disabled pete's "static"-hack with NO_HACK (default on windows)

2003-10-10 14:12  zmoelnig

	* vc6 doesn't like statical arrays with variable sizes

2003-10-10 13:15  zmoelnig

	* updated my vc6-projects

2003-10-10 13:14  zmoelnig

	* disabled warnings on vc6

2003-10-10 13:13  zmoelnig

	* search for libavifile-headers rather than assuming they are in
	  /usr/include/avifile

2003-10-10 13:11  zmoelnig

	* first attempt of a port from [pix_filmQT] to the film*-class.
	  however i have quicktime4windows not installed, so i had no way
	  to compile this yet....

2003-10-10 13:10  zmoelnig

	* made filmAVI work.  a first step for pix_filmNEW to run on
	  windows...

2003-10-10 13:09  zmoelnig

	* for libavifile we used to include <avifile/avifile.h>; since the
	  headers for libavifile-0.7 is located in
	  /usr/include/avifile-0.7/, we now search for the correct path in
	  the "configure" and include only "avifile.h"

2003-10-10 13:07  zmoelnig

	* <unistd.h> is only included if HAVE_LIBAVIPLAY is defined

2003-10-10 13:04  zmoelnig

	* removed "m_film", since it is not needed

2003-10-10 13:03  zmoelnig

	* my vc6-dos-compiler doesn't like <iostream> because it makes it
	  like against some "new" io-libs while it rather needs "old" ones
	  which are requested by <iostream.h>

2003-10-10 13:02  zmoelnig

	* commented out namespace std for windows (vc6 complained about
	  this)

2003-10-10 13:00  zmoelnig

	* now you see something after the first coordinate-change...

2003-10-10 12:59  zmoelnig

	* now using [pix_buf] instead of re-loading the image for each
	  blending-change

2003-10-08 19:33  zmoelnig

	* removed the [pix_rgba], since now [pix_film] should output only
	  RGBA/YUV/Grayscale

2003-10-08 18:55  zmoelnig

	* reported bugfix of filmQT4L

2003-10-08 18:52  zmoelnig

	* this is how [pix_movie] looks like if derived from [pix_filmNEW]
	  (and [pix_texture])

2003-10-08 18:51  zmoelnig

	* using "upsidedown" from imageStruct; added YUV support

2003-10-08 18:09  zmoelnig

	* using "upsidedown" from imageStruct;

2003-10-08 18:06  zmoelnig

	* using "upsidedown" from imageStruct; added this flag to
	  setTexCoords() to indicate whether the texture-coordinates should
	  be flipped or not.  the __APPLE__ define for flipping is
	  therefore obsoleted.

2003-10-08 18:04  zmoelnig

	* added "upsidedown" to imageStruct; this is meant for
	  texture-flipping of the image (most movies are loaded the "wrong"
	  way) upsidedown defaults to true on __APPLE__;  false elsewhere

2003-10-08 17:01  zmoelnig

	* made [pix_movieNEW] (for now; of course this should [pix_movie]
	  LATER a friend of [pix_texture] this will let us use the
	  sophisticated texturing mechanism of [pix_texture] for
	  [pix_movie]

2003-10-07 18:10  zmoelnig

	* moved the pix_film things up a bit, because i had a hard time
	  making [pix_film] an alias for [pix_filmNEW]

2003-10-07 18:09  zmoelnig

	* added "colorspace"-method

2003-10-07 18:09  zmoelnig

	* some bug fixing added "colorspace"-method "post" becomes "DEBUG"
	  which can be turned off.  some reordering of decode-libs:
	  libmpeg3 is better in decoding mpegs then libavifile (less
	  crashes)

2003-10-07 17:47  zmoelnig

	* open() now utilizes setCsizeByFormat()

2003-10-07 17:46  zmoelnig

	* made the openStream sleep a bit. still opening streamed-files
	  sometimes crashes added support for more colour-formats

2003-10-07 17:44  zmoelnig

	* put quite everything (but constructor/destructor) between one
	  huge #ifdef.	the rest should be filled with defaults by the
	  film-class.

2003-10-07 17:43  zmoelnig

	* added colour-change on the fly

2003-10-07 17:40  zmoelnig

	* open() now returns false (to make the skip to next api work)

2003-10-07 17:39  zmoelnig

	* requestColor() now sets "m_wantedFormat"

2003-10-07 17:38  zmoelnig

	* a bit of code-cleanup

2003-10-07 14:01  zmoelnig

	* rewrote a bit in the #ifdef clauses and put them all together.
	  it is really ugly on linux pix_filmNEW is now the default

2003-10-07 13:47  zmoelnig

	* encapsuled everything but constructor/destructor within one big
	  "#ifdef HAVE_QT4L" (using inheritance) made getFrame() return
	  frames of all three colour-spaces.  fixed several bugs

2003-10-07 10:58  zmoelnig

	* encapsuled everything but constructor/destructor within one big
	  "#ifdef HAVE_QT4L" (using inheritance) made getFrame() return
	  frames of all three colour-spaces.  BAD: we only get RGB-images
	  from the qt4l-library. this means:
	  video(YUV)->buffer(RGB)->gem_image(RGBA/YUV/Gray). but what
	  should i do ?

2003-10-07 10:55  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the getFrame() to: a) get frames of different
	  colour-spaces b) decode YUV/Gray really fast (directly access the
	  decoding Y/U/V-planes)

2003-10-07 10:51  zmoelnig

	* added some thoughts about requested/forced colourspaces.  i
	  think, that film* should at least return colour-spaces that could
	  be handled by Gem/openGL itself.  (it doesnt make sense for
	  [pix_film] to handle IMG_FMT_RGB15) so the cs-request should
	  really be a force and not just a suggestion

2003-10-07 10:46  zmoelnig

	* added fromRGB16() to retrieve data from 16bit encoded RGB.  added
	  fromYV12(Y,U,V) which does not assume that the U and V planes are
	  directly after the Y plane. this is handy if we have independent
	  planes

2003-10-03 16:28  zmoelnig

	* GL_RGBA is not defined at openGL<1.2 (i think); furthermore the
	  include-check for CPPExtern.h is already made in CPPExtern.h

2003-10-03 15:59  zmoelnig

	* put quite everything (but constructor/destructor) between one
	  huge #ifdef.	the rest should be filled with defaults by the
	  film-class.

2003-10-03 15:59  zmoelnig

	* put quite everything (but constructor/destructor) between one
	  huge #ifdef.	the rest should be filled with defaults by the
	  film-class.  on close() the filehandler is set to NULL (caused to
	  crash on multiple closes)

2003-10-02 16:47  zmoelnig

	* removed #include <OpenGL/gl.h> (it is included in GemBase anyhow)
	  ifdef'ed the #include <OpenGL/glu.h> to __APPLE__ (else <GL/gl.h>

2003-09-30 20:16  zmoelnig

	* filmQT4L procuces RGB if RGBA is not supported by the codec

2003-09-30 20:11  zmoelnig

	* removed the processRGBAImage-call (anyhow, it didn't do anything)

2003-09-30 20:11  zmoelnig

	* added YUV support split processImage into processRGBAImage and
	  processGrayImage

2003-09-29 05:26  tigital

	* corrected text

2003-09-29 05:11  tigital

	* added camera_setup()

2003-09-29 05:10  tigital

	* initial commit

2003-09-24 06:51  tigital

	* more work on yuv processing, but it still doesn't work

2003-09-24 06:46  tigital

	* removed some unused code, cleanup

2003-09-24 06:44  tigital

	* removed some unused code

2003-09-24 06:42  tigital

	* added __APPLE__ "macosx_math.h", some unused cleanup

2003-09-24 06:38  tigital

	* fixed "comparison between signed & unsigned int" warning on line
	  117, in processRGBAImage()

2003-09-24 06:33  tigital

	* replaced __APPLE__ define with macosx_math.h

2003-09-24 06:32  tigital

	* added default: break; to PAAvoid::Execute() & PABounce::Execute,
	  because PDPoint, PDLine, PDBox, PDCylinder, PDCone, and PDBlob
	  aren't taken care of...also replaced __APPLE__ defines with
	  macosx_math.h

2003-09-24 06:27  tigital

	* added default: break; to _pCallActionList(), because PAHeaderID
	  isn't taken care of

2003-09-23 05:21  tigital

	* added glFinish() & several glPixelStorei()'s for __APPLE__ for
	  speed up?:  is this applicable to all platforms?

2003-09-23 05:16  tigital

	* removed unused variables

2003-09-23 04:50  tigital

	* changed comment from "mousePressed" to "KeyBoardPressed"

2003-09-23 04:47  tigital

	* reordered initializers to shut up gcc warning

2003-09-22 12:04  zmoelnig

	* updated documentation

2003-09-22 12:03  zmoelnig

	* added Gray-support YUV-support is still under construction (but
	  now does something (stupid) instead of nothing)

2003-09-22 12:02  zmoelnig

	* added an inlet for the size of the metaimage

2003-09-22 12:01  zmoelnig

	  position -- useful for moving particle sources (but alas, only
	  one particle at a time)

2003-07-15 09:36  zmoelnig

	* [part_veldomain] sets the velocity into a specified domain (like

	  fd was>0.  fixed.

2003-07-11 15:55  zmoelnig

	* added a flag to WindowInfo, whether a constant context has been
	  established.	the destroyWindow depends partly on this (because
	  my laptop (with an ati mobility l6) crashed when destroying a
	  non-constant context.  also changed the line "do not continue" to
	  "continue at your own risk"

2003-07-09 14:07  zmoelnig

	  have added the videoDV4L support.  and there is now a "driver"
	  message, that let's you choose between various drivers (like
	  video4linux and video1394) yes, the way the modules are
	  registered is really BAD.  have to change this soon

2003-07-09 12:56  zmoelnig

	* hopefully this is a real support for video over ieee1394
	  (firewire/dv)  under linux!

	* made CLAMP_TO_EDGE the repeat for TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_EXT

2003-05-20 02:24  tigital

	* commented out call to pix_film_setup():  is this needed on any
	  platform (seems like we went thru this before)?...

2003-05-20 02:21  tigital

	* add #ifdef __APPLE__ to correctly include headers

2003-05-19 06:03  cclepper

	  than the size of the cropped(!)  image

2003-05-18 21:32  zmoelnig

	* added method for grey-images

2003-05-18 21:29  zmoelnig

	  are no libdv/dv.h headers)

2003-05-16 16:40  zmoelnig

	* fixed a typo that searched in "search_libs" instead of expanding
	  $search_libs

2003-05-16 16:38  zmoelnig

	* fixed a typo that searched for "searchlibs" instead of
	  "$searchlibs"

2003-05-16 14:36  zmoelnig

2003-05-16 14:36  zmoelnig

	* debian package managing module: for creation of debs

2003-05-16 13:10  zmoelnig

	* commited result of merge

2003-05-16 13:07  zmoelnig

	* moved macors for image-processing from GemPixUtil to GemFuncUtil
	  (since they are functions, although they probably have not much
	  use for things other than PixProcessing (GemPixFun.h ?)

2003-05-16 12:53  zmoelnig

	* copied yuv_posterize to pix_posterize. YUV only. hope this works
	  as it should

2003-05-16 12:52  zmoelnig

	* switched back from PALETTE_YUV422 to PALETTE_YUV420P.  it seems
	  as if video4linux means something different with YUV422 (or
	  similar formats). too bad, conversions (copying!) again

2003-05-14 11:01  zmoelnig

	* ifdefed the use of GL_UNPACK_CLIENT_STORAGE_APPLE obviously some
	  other changes, which i hope do not break anything, but i guess
	  most of it is new indentation

2003-05-14 10:58  zmoelnig

	* removed tv_* help-patches, since they are not used any more

2003-05-14 10:03  zmoelnig

	* added data-acquisition "fromYUV422" added offsets chY0, chY1,
	  chU, chV for UYVY interleaved data added a string2format
	  converter (like 'rgba' to GL_RGBA), only Grey, YUV, and RGBA are
	  supported

2003-05-14 09:59  zmoelnig

	* added a topmostMess (a nop)

2003-05-14 09:58  zmoelnig

	* ifdef'ed the call for openGL-extension "rectangle-texture", since
	  there were problems when Gem was compiled without
	  rectangle-texture-support, but the drivers supported it (namely
	  nvidia-driver)

2003-05-14 09:50  zmoelnig

	* oops, missed one thing: when yuv was requested, we didn't
	  directly captured to yuv422 but rather to yuv420p. fixed

2003-05-14 09:48  zmoelnig

	* for testing i had hardcorded requests for some "wrong"
	  colour-spaces.  hopefully this is removed now

2003-05-14 09:46  zmoelnig

	* on platform that do not support yuv422-openGL-renderings (i
	  haven't managed to make my geforce behave the way i expected, and
	  of course there are other cards that will never support
	  yuv-textures), we now have implicit yuv2rgb-conversion

2003-05-14 09:44  zmoelnig

	* copy and pasted the yuv_emboss into the Pixes source.  for now,
	  only yuv is supported

2003-05-14 09:44  zmoelnig

	* yet another colour-space converter ??? don't know whether this
	  makes sense (remove it LATER)

2003-05-14 09:33  zmoelnig

	* added convert and emboss

2003-05-14 09:32  zmoelnig

	* added aliases for [pix_depot] and friends

2003-05-14 09:32  zmoelnig

	* [pix_put]: the frame# is now deleted after an image has been
	  written into the depot. the next incoming image will not be
	  stored until another frame# is given.

2003-05-13 04:06  tigital

	* added #define for logf(), expf(), sinf(), & cosf() on OS X (sin()
	  et. al. are already done w/double precision)

2003-05-13 04:00  tigital

	* added #define for sqrtf() on OS X

2003-05-13 03:59  tigital

2003-05-12 10:59  cclepper

	* added 'mode' message to switch between power-of-2 and rectangle
	  textures

2003-05-11 16:36  dheck

	* Added pix_snap2tex for snapping directly to a texture.  This may
	  need some experimentation with appropriate pixel formats for each
	  platform to achieve good performance.

2003-05-11 08:01  cclepper

	* changed the Mac format to GL_BGRA_EXT

2003-05-07 19:24  zmoelnig

	* renamed [pix_depot] and fellows to [pix_buffer] et al.

2003-05-07 13:10  zmoelnig

	* added a deviceMess for setting which device to use

2003-05-07 13:07  zmoelnig

	* there is now an alias for [pix_separator]

2003-05-07 12:55  zmoelnig

	* added colourConversion routines to GemPixUtils (for now only
	  non-optimized) maybe they should rather be in GemPixConvert ?
	  datasize is now private

2003-05-07 12:38  zmoelnig

	* since datasize in imageStruct is now private, we use setBlack()
	  to delete the image-buffer

2003-05-07 12:35  zmoelnig

	* used to crash when the data-pointer was zero

2003-05-07 12:19  zmoelnig

	* i once uncommented the "realStopRendering" things, because i
	  didn't know what it was for.	trying to compile gem2pdp i noticed
	  that this was needed.  yes, i don't like it either, when changes
	  are made to the repository wihtout documentation

2003-05-07 12:11  zmoelnig

	* upgraded to libarticle-1.20 this effects some of the [part_*]
	  objects (eg: [part_info] now has another output for the age of
	  the particle,...)

	* upgraded to 1.20

	  virtual too)

2003-04-28 19:22  zmoelnig

	* ???

2003-04-28 19:21  zmoelnig

	  anything yet...)

2003-04-28 19:19  zmoelnig

	* cursorMessage should return something. it does so now.

2003-04-28 19:17  zmoelnig

	* (nothing), like dos2unix...

2003-04-28 19:15  zmoelnig

	* added the continueRender() function (important to output several
	  gemlists (like with [part_render]) uncommented the stoprender()
	  thing. what is it for ?

2003-04-28 19:13  zmoelnig

2003-04-08 10:26  zmoelnig

	* changed the base class from GemPixObj to GemBase (so we have info
	  on every image). maybe this was not a great idea ...( but not
	  that bad either)

2003-04-08 10:22  zmoelnig

	* the parent class for os/lib dependent video-grabbing (childs
	  include videoV4L, hopefully will include video1394, videoDS,
	  videoWDM,...)

2003-04-06 21:27  zmoelnig

	* GemPixObj: i think there was a bug with not initializing pointers
	  the rest is no real changes (only "visiting" the files)

	* a threaded class for video capturing under linux

2003-04-06 21:22  zmoelnig

2003-04-03 17:17  zmoelnig

	* [pix_depot] can store images (any size, fixed number) (TODO: add
	  a way to load decompress movies directly into [pix_depot]). it is
	  like [table] [pix_get] gets frames from [pix_depot] (like
	  [tabread]) [pix_put] writes frames to [pix_depot] (like
	  [tabwrite])

2003-04-01 07:25  tigital

	* OSX only:  turns out that SampleNumToMediaTime() only worked when
	  1 movie was loaded...switched to a much simpler method of
	  calculating m_reqFrame's m_movieTime...which works with at least
	  five simultaneously running films!

2003-03-31 18:46  tigital

	* OSX only:  forgot to set one flag correctly

2003-03-31 08:37  tigital

	  done in the cpp-file)

2003-02-24 12:40  zmoelnig

	* added a reallocate() message to imageStruct.	This does only
	  allocate memory, if the previous buffer is smaller than the

	  image, 2nd bang releases image, which rebounds back to flat

2003-02-10 01:08  tigital

	* slideSquare: creates a field of squares which reaveal texture
	  while moving left to right

2003-02-10 01:07  tigital

	* ripple:  bang to inlet causes image rippling, center of ripple is
	  movable via x and y input: see example/07.texture/

2003-02-10 00:53  tigital

	* now has controls for size, speed, and mode; currently only works
	  with [pix_texture]; also requires rotateXYZ, scale, transposeXYZ

2003-02-03 17:55  zmoelnig

	* changed the identifier for the list-ID from "list" to "gllist",

	  warning when compiled without GLUT (is this new ?)

2003-02-03 17:37  zmoelnig

2002-12-16 18:59  zmoelnig

	* yuv_*: (think) i changed these to the new process*Image()
	  functions

2002-12-16 18:54  zmoelnig

	* pix_info: get information on pixes (xsize, ysize, csize, format,
	  data) pix_yuv : convert images to YUV (for now only RGBA); needs
	  testing pix_rgba: provides a function for YUV; needs testing *
	  : new process*Image() functions for RGBA, YUV,...

2002-12-16 18:40  zmoelnig

	* teapot: if !HAVE_GLUT we still support [teapot], only the
	  rendering is void text2d: the mac-#ifdefs didn't compile on
	  linux, so i fixed them

2002-12-16 18:36  zmoelnig

	* GemPix*Obj: hopefully fixed the bug that appeared when deleting
	  pix_fx	now we cache the whole pixBuf-structure and return
	  it on postrendering GemPixUtil: now provides a function for
	  copying imageStruct-information GemGlutObj: if !HAVE_GLUT, we
	  only throw an error at object-creation

2002-12-14 05:43  tigital

	* added MACOSX support

2002-12-09 12:36  zmoelnig

	* rewrote the <processImage>-callers.	processImage is now used
	  for images of any(!) format.	 thus the programmer has to care
	  for the format him/herself	  the format specific functions are
	  processImageRGBA and similar		the same goes for
	  PixDualObjects (processRGBA_Gray etc...)  deleted pix_fx	the
	  pix_fx functionality is now in GemPixObj    this functionality
	  is: save the image-state before it is processed      and
	  reconstruct it in the postrender function   so we can change
	  size/format and even bend the data-pointer	 and objects
	  "before" will not notice (and crash) revised 3 openGL objects
	  (urgh: lots of work to do still)

2002-12-08 22:41  tigital

	* added support for MACOSX
