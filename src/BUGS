if a image-stream created by [pix_video] is processed by some fx, sometimes the fx seems to "not work" (framewise: some frames are processed others are not), i think this is a problem with thread-syncing and in-place manipulation. -- maybe all threaded pix-sources should copy the new data to a save place (where the thread has no access)

ripple: what is the height for ?
rubber/ripple: sizeMess obsolete ?

release critical: [filmQT4L] produces RGB output if RGBA is not supported by the codec -- FIXED

RC: the linker flags for libavifile could be obtained via `avifile-config`. these are more correct than just adding `-lavifile` (aka: i had big problems without these..) -- FIXED

the "--without-aviplay" flag doesn't really work -- FIXED

Gem doesn't load if the no font-support AND "-Wl,-rpath,/usr/lib -laviplay" is specified (something with cannot resolve symbol "GemState" in TextBase::render()


pix_filmDS produces BGR-output -- FIXED (now it produces RGBA, YUV and Grey on demand)
