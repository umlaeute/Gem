This is the videoIO framework for PD
====================================

This framework should provide a general videoIO framework with which
IO plugins can be loaded at runtime.
At the moment there are only Gstreamer plugins avaliable, which should
work on very much platforms, but for now it's only tested on Linux.


Dependencies
============

The core
--------
PD >= 0.34                                                                 # wie GEM???

The Gstreamer plugins
---------------------
Gstreamer >= 0.10.13
Gstreamer Base Plugins >= 0.10.13
Gstreamer Good Plugins >= 0.10.6
Gstreamer Bad Plugins >= 0.10.5 (CVS)
  - You will need the CVS version to get the Gstreamer appsrc and
    appsink elements.
Gstreamer Ugly Plugins >= 0.10.6
  - You will need the ugly plugins only if you want to play DVDs or
    some other non-free things.
Gstreamer FFmpeg Plugins >= 0.10.2
    

Compilation
===========

The core will be compiled with the GEM buildsystem.
The plugins will be build with the makefile in videoIO/plugins.


Writing new plugins
===================

If you want to write a new plugin you can simply derive from the base
classes (i.e FileRead, FileWrite and DeviceRead). You then also need
to have a registerPlugin(VIOKernel &) method which registers the plugin
to the kernel. It would be good to look at an existing plugin
(e.g. FileReadGst) to see how this works.
In VIOKernel::loadPlugins() you then also have to add a 
registerPlugin("YourPluginName") call. Then the kernel will try to
load the plugin.
