General Rendering Issues
: alpha in gemwindow?
: stencil buffer

Missing help-patches
+ glsl_* (DONE)
+ arb-shaders (DONE)
+ pix_record
+ pix_share_{read,write} (DONE)
:+ gemframebuffer/gempbuffer

Untested objects
:+ gemframebuffer/gempbuffer
+ pix_share_{read,write} (DONE, works now on linux; has to be tested on OSX again)
: vertex_* ?


Object specific bugs
+ [pix_write] upside down when using jpg (WORKSFORME - confirmed by cyrille henry) 
+ [pix_image] sometimes crashes when loading non-existant image (or image which is neither jpeg nor tiff) (WORKSFORME - confirmed by cyrille henry) 
+ [separator] memleak (fixed, needs TESTing)
+ [separator]: yields a stack-overflow error when more [separators] are chained (due to limited stack-size of color-matrix,... on some implementations); fix: keep track of the used stacks and only push/pop when possible (hopefully FIXED)
+ there is some openGL-error (invalid enum, iirc) when using [vertex_program]; this seems to happen only if gemwindow was open first, then closed and then the [vertex_program] patch gets loaded
- pix_freeframe not supported on x86_64 architectures (needs discussion on the freeframe list: people there are a bit reluctant to change the specs (like enforcing 32bit pointers)
+ pix_video does not work with certain devices (like philips webcam) (seems to be FIXED; check back with normal capture cards; v4l-2 seems to work too...)


OS specific bugs
linux:
:- sometimes window freezes on "destroy"; (JMZ: i experience this sometimes on improper shutdown, but after some (up to 30) seconds, the window finally gets destroyed and pd exits fine; if this is the same as the reported bug, than it is rather an inconvenience than a real bug)
+ when the window is closed from "outside", destroying it (and sometimes even rendering to it) will destroy the window (hopefully FIXED)
+ pix_record still not compiling with old libquicktime (FIXED)
: resizing the window yields weird results



osx:
+ autoconf buildsystem non-functional
+ remove checks for valid openGL-context (DONE)
: SequenceGrabber long-term stability (keeps logging you out)
+ uyvy/bgra/yv12 conversions altivec'd (DONE)

w32:
:- [pix_share_*] does not exist since the shared-memory concept has not made it to redmond yet
+ objects are missing in the vs.net project: gemframebuffer GemSplash part_sink pix_fiducialtrack pix_hit (seems tobe FIXED in recent cc builds; check again)
