gem-0.88-cvs (so far):
- fixed some bugs with avi-reading, video4linux, model, imageInPlace,...
- rewrote the rendering system:
-- previous versions built a dag (directed acyclic graph ?) when rendering was started, which established the static rendering-chain
-- now in each rendering-cycle the [gemhead] "bangs" the following gem.objects
-- this means:
--- when modifying a gem.objects you don't have to restart the rendering
--- when deleting a connection between 2 gem.objects, the lower (unconnected) part won't be rendered immediately
--- we can now retrigger parts of the render-chain (cool for particles, arrays,...)
- the [gemhead]s priority can be "set" dynamically: so we can change the rendering-order on the fly (good for complex alpha-blending)
- [gemhead]'s with negative priority will be rendered AFTER those with a positive one, AND will not be affected by the "view"point message (good for displaying help-messages, logos, etc...)

gem-0.87:
- added much documentation
- you can set the title of the GEM-window with the "title"-message. Up till now only one symbol is allowed.
- added [gemkeyboard] and [gemkeyname] for keyboard-interaction in the GEM-window. However, Windows and Linux versions do not give the same results...
- added Red/Green stereo
- cleaned up the stereo-thing. we can switch between the different stereo-modes (including no-stereo) while rendering
- added "fullscreen" mode
- fixed "border" under linux
- "cursor" is now available on Windoze
- readded "externals" with additional libraries to close up with the windows version::
- added pix_movie for Linux (mpeg2+quicktime-support)
- added pix_film, which is in fact like pix_movie but does not write the pix-buf directly into a texture
- fixed the model
- added the stupid "teapot"
- added a pix_write that let's you capture the current screen into a file (TIFF/JPEG)
- added pix_hsv2rgb, pix_rgb2hsv (colour-space converters)
- added pix_blob (center of gravity:: colour detection)
- added pix_curves, pix_histo
- added pix_set, pix_dump
- added pix_pix2sig~, pix_sig2pix~
- started a new class "TV" for pix-operations that change over time: like tv_movement (formerly: pix_movement), tv_biquad, tv_rtx; but i am not really happy with this...
- started a new pix_fx class for inserting pix-FX. there is not much about it, but you can now bend the image.data pointer to wherever you like (including size-changes, format-changes) - it will be bent back in the postrender()-thing
- started to import classes from effecTV (by Fukuchi Kentarou): pix_aging, pix_puzzle; most of his FX are real crap, but some are ok and it's easy to import them
- made a pix_rgba

gem-0.84-5:
- bugfixes for gemwin "cursor" message (cursor [1|0])
- removed "externals" with additional libraries, they are separated now
- added a "freq" and "mode" message to Linux video object, you can watch
  TV now ...
- it is possible to add the display to the create command for X windows,
  whole initialization stuff is moved into the create method,
  so you can look at the patches without having succesfully generated
  an OpenGl context.
- made the pix_video and pix_movie into real base classes of OS specific
  classes. The OS spezific classes for Windows and SGI have to be fixed ..


gem-0.84-4:
- text2d:  added a message "alias", which toggles between antialiases 
  and standard fonts. Usage "alias 1" or "alias 0"

- gemwin:  additional message cursor, which hides the cursor in 
  GEM windows
